Obesity has an impact on everyday activities, including sleeping and moving. Obesity is beyond a cosmetic problem. It is a medical condition that raises the risk of several other illnesses and health issues. These may include heart disease, blood sugar, high blood pressure, high lipids, liver disease, and sleep apnea. It can also impact the health of bones and fertility, and it raises the risk of developing several cancers. The standard measure of obesity in adults is a BMI of 27 to 30 or greater. Severe or morbid obesity is defined as having a BMI of 40 or above. Growth charts are used to measure childhood obesity."

        "subtitle": "Three Common Misconceptions About Obesity",
        "content": "1. Obesity Is a Lifestyle Choice and Not a Disease\nConsiderations of obesity as a disease - When one constantly eats more calories than the body needs, it causes fat cells to grow larger. It increases the overall size of fat tissue. This leads to health issues related to excess fat (like sleep apnea, joint problems affecting mobility, and skin irritation) and causes fat cells and fat tissue dysfunction. This dysfunction, called adiposopathy, can lead to immune and hormone imbalances that contribute to common metabolic disorders seen in medical care, such as high blood sugar, high blood pressure, increased levels of harmful fats in the blood, heart disease, and cancer.\n\n2. An Increase in Body Weight Is Always Due to an Increase in Body Fat. Those With Decreased Muscle and Normal Body Weight Do Not Develop Complications of Obesity\nA body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or higher is generally considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher is considered diagnostic for obesity. However, BMI might not always give an accurate picture of every person. It also varies depending on race, gender, and menopausal status. People with a lot of muscle can have a high BMI without having a high body fat percentage. \n\nOn the other hand, some people with less muscle mass might have a normal BMI but still have a high percentage of body fat, which is called sarcopenic obesity. People with sarcopenic obesity have a higher risk of conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.\n\n3. Obesity Is Mostly Due to a Defined Genetic Abnormality\nMany people think that their obesity is mainly due to their genes. However, it is not usually caused by a specific genetic problem. Obesity does have a genetic aspect and tends to run in families. Estimates show that about 60 percent of the genetic influence on obesity comes from multiple genes working together rather than a single, clear genetic issue.\n\nAt iCliniq, we understand the complexities of diagnosing obesity and offer a platform for second opinions; you can consult our doctors for expert advice and personalized recommendations."

        "content": "Weight loss drugs are pharmaceutical medications designed to aid individuals in achieving weight loss goals by targeting various mechanisms involved in appetite regulation, metabolism, or fat absorption. These medications can complement lifestyle changes, such as diet and exercise, to facilitate weight loss and a reduced risk of chronic diseases linked to obesity. Studies have demonstrated that weight loss drugs not only assist in weight reduction but also contribute to preventing obesity-related health consequences. For example, drugs like Orlistat have been shown to facilitate a reduction of at least 5 percent in body weight over the course of a year. These medications work through several mechanisms. First, they can suppress appetite, making it easier for individuals to stick to a low-calorie diet. Second, weight loss drugs can enhance metabolism, increasing the body's ability to burn calories and fat, particularly with regular physical activity. Third, some medications inhibit fat absorption in the digestive system, decreasing the number of calories absorbed from food. This trait can be especially advantageous for those who find it difficult to stick to a low-fat diet."

It also provides an insight into these developments and their implications for managing obesity and overweight conditions. Furthermore, it explores the role of weight loss drugs in addressing obesity, delving into their types, effectiveness, and safety considerations. While weight loss drugs can offer valuable assistance in combating obesity, their long-term use raises concerns regarding efficacy and potential drawbacks. Monitoring for adverse effects, managing tolerance and dependence, and addressing lifestyle factors are critical components of prolonged treatment with these medications. Nevertheless, the future of weight loss drugs shows promise, with ongoing research and development initiatives poised to enhance their effectiveness and safety profiles. "

Weight loss pills are recommended for:\nPeople who have failed to achieve significant weight loss after approximately six months of lifestyle modifications.\nIndividuals with a BMI of over 30 kg/sq.m (kilograms per square meter). \n\nMedical management for obesity has recently attracted attention globally from patients' and healthcare professionals' perspectives; however, the amount of extra weight loss can be attributed to approximately less than five kilograms (11 pounds) in one year. Nevertheless, this weight loss has also contributed to improvements in glycemic control, hypertension, insulin sensitivity, and dyslipidemia in obese patients. The main aim of weight management is to prevent cardiovascular risks and reduce obesity-related morbidity and mortality, and these weight-loss drugs are shown to possess certain additional benefits. \n\nThe United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has approved several weight loss pills.

        "subtitle": "1. Drugs That Interfere With Fat Absorption",
        "content": "Orlistat is a medication approved for the long-term management of obesity. It is a reversible gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor that inactivates the hydrolyzation of dietary fat, thus preventing its absorption by about 30 percent and decreasing the patient's calorie intake. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in obese adolescents aged 12 to 16 years for 54 weeks to assess the effect of Orlistat on body composition and weight. At the end of the study, it was observed that the BMI (body mass index) was reduced from the baseline by 0.55 with Orlistat, but in placebo, it was increased by 0.31. Therefore, Orlistat combined with exercise, diet, and behavioral modification demonstrated statistically significant improvement in weight management. In the adolescent population, the use of Orlistat for up to one year is considered safe. \n\nA recent randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study in adolescents revealed that Orlistat did not significantly affect weight loss at six months. Hence, more research is necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of Orlistat in adolescents. Some common side effects of Orlistat include bloating sensations, abdominal pain, flatulence, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. It may be due to unabsorbed fat present in the intestine. Vitamin supplementation is recommended in long-term treatment with Orlistat patients because reduced fat absorption can lead to a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K."

It has more significant weight loss effects and lowers heart rate and blood pressure than Diethylpropion.\nDiethylpropion: Results in a 3 kg (6.6 lbs) weight loss in six months.\nBoth drugs have side effects like irritability, insomnia, headache, nervousness, and palpitations and are restricted to short-term use (less than 12 weeks).\nSerotonergic Drugs:\nFenfluramine and Dexfenfluramine: Release serotonin, creating satiety, especially for fats, but were withdrawn by the US FDA due to heart valve damage and primary pulmonary hypertension.\nSerotonergic and Adrenergic Drug:\nSibutramine: Inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, suppressing appetite and increasing thermogenesis. Effective for long-term obesity management in patients with a BMI over 25 kg/mÂ², leading to an average weight loss of 4.45 kg (9.8 lbs) in 12 months.

        "subtitle": "7 Weight Loss Pills and Their Secrets",
        "content": "Weight loss pills are available as oral tablets and injections that can be self-administered. They work in different ways to treat obesity and overweight, depending on the group to which they belong. Current pharmacotherapy for obesity mainly targets neurohormonal dysregulations that are responsible for weight gain and also prevent sustained weight loss and its complications. Different weight loss pills include:\n\nTirzepatide: It is a recent weight loss drug and is administered subcutaneously once a week. Studies (SURMONT-1) have demonstrated that participants lost up to 21 percent of their body weight using the 15 mg (milligram) dose once a week.\n\nOrlistat: It is approved for adult and adolescent obesity and works by blocking certain enzymes such as gastrointestinal lipases, reducing the amount of fat absorption from the food consumed, thus promoting weight loss. In the United States, a lower dose of 60 mg three times daily is approved for over-the-counter use. However, clinical studies have shown that participants lost significant weight during the first year of treatment with Orlistat but regained half as much weight during the second year. The drug has been demonstrated to lower serum glucose levels and improve insulin sensitivity. It also reduces low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - glycosylated hemoglobin).\n\nPhentermine-Topiramate: Phentermine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and Topiramate is an anticonvulsant drug. This combination therapy was approved by the US FDA in 2012 for long-term treatment of obesity in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/sq m or a BMI of more than 27 kg/sq m with at least one weight-related disorder. It increases the release of norepinephrine and decreases its uptake in hypothalamic nuclei, thus resulting in decreased food intake. It functions as an adrenergic agonist, activating the sympathetic nervous system to enhance energy expenditure. The drug lowers the appetite, reduces hunger, and creates a feeling of fullness.\n\nSemaglutide: This drug is used for individuals with obesity and rare inherited disorders. It mimics a hormone known as glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and targets the area of the brain that regulates food intake and appetite. The FDA approves it under different names and dosages, and it also helps treat type 2 diabetes. It is also known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in obese individuals. A once-a-week dose of Semaglutide has demonstrated an average of 15 percent weight loss in adults and about 16 percent reduction in BMI in children above 12 years. \n\nSetmelanotide: It acts by activating melanocortin receptors, reduces the appetite and calorie intake, and causes a feeling of fullness. It also increases metabolism, thus helping with weight loss. However, it does not treat genetic defects.\n\nLiraglutide: It mimics GLP-1 and targets the brain sites that regulate appetite and food intake. It has also been approved by the US FDA and helps treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nNaltrexone-Bupropion: Naltrexone is used in the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction, and Bupropion helps to treat depression. This combination therapy is very effective as it reduces hunger, boosts metabolism, and develops a sensation of fullness sooner during food intake."

This also strengthens the highly integrated gut-brain neuroendocrine system, facilitating energy homeostasis and preventing body mass loss. \n\nLifestyle medicine focuses on healthy eating, increased physical activity, stress management, avoiding substance abuse, adequate sleep, and good social behavior, which, in turn, can prevent diabetes and heart diseases. Before undertaking substantial modifications, it is advisable to seek advice from a healthcare provider or a registered dietitian, as it may lead to severe fatigue, headache, or nutritional deficiencies. Traditional lifestyle modification begins by monitoring food intake and physical activity, which are necessary for maintaining an energy balance."

Therefore, healthcare professionals emphasize reducing portion sizes, fat, and sugar intake and avoiding junk foods, which may reduce intake by approximately 500 to 750 kcal/day (kilocalories per day). \n\nA personalized balanced diet is also recommended based on the individual's BMI. Roughly 15 percent of energy must be obtained from proteins, 20 to 35 percent from fats, and the remaining from carbohydrates is preferred, or it can be slightly modified (25 percent from proteins) to meet the individual diet preferences. \n\nStrategies such as shopping only for the specific food products required, checking nutritional value before consumption, eating home-cooked meals, and storing foods out of sight can be beneficial in reducing the daily calorie intake. Starting physical activities such as aerobics or walking initially for around 150 minutes per week and gradually increasing up to 250 minutes; monitoring the weight at least weekly; and adjusting the eating patterns and physical activity based on the weight change is suggested for weight-loss maintenance."

Studies have also shown that exercise can increase the absorption of certain medications due to improved blood circulation to the tissues. \n\nMany doctors initially recommend diet changes, regular exercise, and weight loss to lower blood pressure and cholesterol and prevent obesity. When these measures are ineffective, medicines are prescribed. However, continuing a healthy diet and engaging in physical activity with medications is necessary to achieve better results."

Researchers have gathered data regarding smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and body weight among 40,000 adults with no history of cardiovascular diseases and compared people who were prescribed medicines for high cholesterol and high blood pressure and those who were under medication. This study demonstrated that people taking medicines tend to exercise less and gain more weight. Around 82 percent were more likely to be obese compared to people who were not using any medications. This can be because many assume that after starting medications, they no longer need to exercise or eat healthy food. However, medications also have certain limitations and side effects, whereas healthy lifestyle habits can improve overall well-being and help the medicines to be more effective. \n\nA blend of lifestyle adjustments and therapeutic interventions can address obesity. Lifestyle changes are a more natural method and are considered an integral component in weight loss management. The new generation treatment has the potential to manage obesity along with lifestyle modifications. These drugs help not only in weight reduction but also improve the cholesterol profile, insulin resistance, and blood pressure. However, these changes must be personalized depending on the BMI and health condition of the individuals to strengthen their implementation and long-term compliance."

        "subtitle": "Key Categories and Trending Weight Loss Pills",
        "content": "Considering the working principle with which weight loss pills palliate the body weight, they could be categorized into the following subsets:\n\n1. **Appetite Suppressants:**\nIngesting more calories instigates weight gain, so the calorie intake should be compromised to downgrade body weight. Appetite suppressants are a weight loss drug group that promotes weight loss by withholding and muting the expression of hunger. As appetite suppressants cover hunger or appetite, they enable the person to cut down on food intake, directly reducing the calorie intake. \n\nAppetite suppressants rely on the body's chemical messengers and protein molecules to inflict gut fullness. Appetite suppression is instituted through hormones (ghrelin, insulin, cortisol, and leptin), GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1âproteinaceous entity), and neurotransmitters (serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid).\n\n**Trending Drugs:**\n* **Phentermine:** Phentermine interrupts and cuts off the brain's hunger signals. Phentermine could be employed either alone or with other weight-loss drugs. Lomaira and Adipex-P are the brand names under which Phentermine is being marketed.\n* **Lorcaserin:** This medication inflicts gut fullness through its serotonin receptor agonism and thereby mitigates calorie intake. The routinely advocated formulation is in tablet form and is retailed as Belviq.\n* **Liraglutide:** This drug suppresses appetite by stimulating the activity of GLP-1. Saxenda is the marketed Liraglutide formulation meant for subcutaneous (formulation deposited underneath the skin) delivery. \n* **Benzphetamine:** It downturns hunger and thus expedites weight loss. Benzphetamine therapy should never be teamed with other drugs, not even with other weight loss medications. Regimex and Didrex are Benztamine's in-demand brands.\n\n2. **Metabolic Modulators:**\nThe metabolic modulator drug group brings forth weight loss by tempering and tuning the body's metabolism, which is how energy or calories are expended. Upscaling the energy expenditure forces more of the calories to burn up; this is how metabolic modulation favors weight loss.  \n\n**Trending Drugs:**\n* **Recombinant Leptin:** Recombinant leptin works by upscaling the body's metabolic process, which gears up energy expenditure. Therefore, more calories are exploited, which gravitates toward weight loss. Apart from being a metabolic enhancer, Recombinant leptin also invokes gut fullness by instigating appetite suppression.\n\n3. **Fat Absorption Inhibitors:**\nThis particular weight loss drug group reveals its therapeutic implications by repressing the uptake and processing of dietary fats. Fat absorption inhibitors obstruct the fat molecules from being uptaken from the intestines; thus, the fat molecules are expelled and unabsorbed. This skips the calories that would otherwise be absorbed from the dietary fats.\n\n**Trending Drugs:**\n* **Orlistat:** Orlistat disables and mutes the activities of the pancreatic and gastric lipases, which are implicated in fat breakdown and uptake. Under Orlistat's influence, around 25 percent of the dietary fats consumed will be stamped out as unabsorbed. Xenical and Alli are the brand denominations for the Orlistat formulation.\n\n4. **Thermogenic Agents:**\nAnother potential weight loss drug class is the thermogenic agent, where weight loss is prompted by underscoring thermogenesis. It is through thermogenesis that the body maintains its normal temperature. However, it is achieved through the expense of calories. Thermogenic drugs gravitate toward calorie expenditure through thermogenesis. The calorie expenditure directly leverages the weight loss. Both thermogenic drugs and metabolic modulator drugs have overlapping attributes.\n\n**Trending Drugs:**\n* **Ephedrine:** Ephedrine promotes weight loss by augmenting thermogenesis. Combining Ephedrine and caffeine deepens the thermogenic attributes and potentiates the efficacy of lowering body weight. \n* **Sibutramine:** Sibutramine also upregulates thermogenesis. In addition, it could also bring about appetite suppression."

A waist-to-height ratio that falls below 0.5 indicates that the person's fat distribution is lesser; thus, their inclination for health issues is perceived to be lower or minimal. Having said that, there are slight variations in the healthy range between genders. The healthy waist-to-height ratio is estimated to be 0.53 or below for males, while that for females is 0.49 or below.\n\nTo find the ratio of waist to height:\nDetermine the midpoint between the hip bone and the lowest rib.

        "content": "Overweight and obesity is a personal as well as a nationwide economic crisis. The most notable are the direct medical expenses related to treating disorders linked to obesity. Compared to people of lower weight, obese people are much more likely to need home medical care, outpatient appointments, lots of medication, be admitted to the hospital, and have surgery. The expenses of care and hospital stays are higher for obese patients.\n\nThe economic effects of obesity involve indirect expenses associated with decreased or stopped productivity and human resources.\nResearch from several different nations demonstrates that people who are obese miss more work days due to absenteeism and perform less well at work while they are present (presenteeism).\nObesity also raises the risk of unemployment and reduces income.\nPremature deaths from conditions linked to obesity suggest a loss of future economic contributions.\nStudies have shown that obesity has significant negative economic effects in certain nations. Estimates of medical expenses and lost productivity range from 0.13 percent of GDP in Thailand to 9.3 percent in the USA.\n\nIn 2008, obesity cost the US $147 billion in medical expenses, and this number is expected to keep rising. It is not just about healthcareâobesity also leads to $4.3 billion in lost productivity due to absenteeism. By 2018, obesity-related medical costs made up 8.5 percent of total healthcare spending. By 2030, these costs could jump to $48 to $66 billion annually. To meet the demand for healthier options, the food industry is shifting towards more nutritious products, with a global market projected to reach $1 trillion by 2027. These numbers show the urgent need for action to address obesity through healthcare, workplace policies, and better consumer choices."

While GAHT can lead to low long-term risks, transgender women can have a slightly higher chance of experiencing venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). In contrast, transgender men may encounter acne, polycythemia, and alopecia.\n\nGuidelines from the Endocrine Society and World Professional Association for Transgender Health suggest that the hormone levels be maintained within the expected range for the affirmed gender and avoid excessive doses of GAHT to reduce these risks.\n\nHowever, research on how BMI changes in transgender individuals undergoing GAHT is scarce, and studies are still ongoing. Some studies suggest that transgender women have experienced a remarkable increase in BMI after 12 months of GAHT, while transgender men show higher BMI levels after six months and up to 54 months of GAHT.\n\nNevertheless, more long-term studies, especially in the United States, are deemed necessary to gain a better insight into GAHT's impact on BMI."

Keeping track of daily activity with an accelerometer or pedometer is also recommended, which can help, as step counts show how active one is. Everyday activities are as important as structured workouts for getting fit and losing weight. One must be very active (engaging in at least 150-300 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise each week to facilitate weight loss).

Other factors play a crucial role, too, such as genetics, human behavior, hormones, and basal metabolism. Some of these factors are beyond people's control. A gene called ankyrin-B has been discovered by recent studies as a crucial factor in obesity. The study found that variations in the ankyrin-B gene cause too much glucose to enter fat cells, making them grow twice as large.\nResearch also shows that physiological conditions like pregnancy and adolescence and medical conditions like PCOD (polycystic ovary disorder) increase the potential risk of obesity. Additionally, parents' dietary habits and genetics impact children's and adolescents' risk of becoming overweight. However, developing healthy eating habits during childhood can help prevent obesity and related lifestyle issues.

Weight loss medicines can be very advantageous for people who aim to decrease their weight by 10 to 15 percent. People who have other medical conditions and who require more than 20 percent of weight loss are indicated for surgery. However, the latest studies have shown that achieving 20-25 percent weight loss with FDA-approved medications is feasible."

        "content": "Drugs used to lose weight may have adverse consequences, just like any medication. The short-term side effects could be nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, sleeplessness, headache, fatigue, or lightheadedness. Although they are uncommon, long-term severe adverse effects can include elevated blood pressure, palpitations, liver damage, nutritional deficiencies, metabolic changes, anxiety, the risk of dependence, or mood swings. Dietary adjustments, such as incorporating supplements or an all-inclusive balanced diet, can help address nutrient deficiencies that some medications might cause. If side effects are significant after taking these weight loss drugs, medication adjustments, including dose changes or switching to alternative drugs, become mandatory to improve tolerance."

        "content": "Individuals generally do not need to take weight-loss medications for the rest of their lives, but the duration of use can vary based on individual goals and responses. For some, weight-loss medications are prescribed as a long-term strategy to maintain weight loss and prevent weight gain. Also, weight-loss drugs will be reassessed once every three to six months to determine an individual's body responses and adaptation to weight-loss drugs, based on which the duration will be decided. If medication is stopped, especially without implementing effective lifestyle changes, there is a risk of regaining weight. This is because medications often help manage appetite or absorption, and without their aid, individuals might return to previous eating habits or struggle with weight control. So, the key to curbing weight gain and maintaining an optimal weight is to develop habits that help keep the lost weight."

A nutrient-rich diet supports metabolism and physical activity, with high-fiber foods aiding digestion and preventing gastrointestinal issues from medications. Regular exercise boosts metabolism, burns calories, improves cardiovascular health, and enhances insulin sensitivity, which benefits those with obesity, high cholesterol, or diabetes. Additionally, maintaining good mental health is vital, as it supports perseverance and resilience throughout the weight loss journey.

These medications also benefit those with hypercholesterolemia by reducing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, thereby improving lipid profiles. Additionally, weight loss generally lowers heart disease risk by easing the heart's workload and enhancing metabolic health.

The individuals might need higher doses over time to ensure they get the same weight loss outcome. There are reports of suicidal tendencies in individuals consuming weight loss drugs in the long term. For this reason, the authorities have recommended issuing a warning on the medication so it can be used cautiously. Research is in progress regarding the long-term usage of the newer weight loss drugs. Many weight loss drugs that were previously very promising have now been taken off the market owing to their fatal side effects.\n\nDespite all these risks, individuals might feel these drugs are the only solution to losing weight and improving their self-esteem. These are the only benefits in this regard. A modest ten percent weight loss may be achieved in clinical practice beyond four years.

Also, the excretion of most weight loss drugs through breast milk has not been extensively studied. Aiming for rapid weight loss in the lactation period with the help of weight loss medicines can have other deleterious effects as well. Studies show that rapid weight loss during breastfeeding can release persistent organic pollutants (POPs) stored in body fat into the bloodstream and breast milk.

Many weight loss drugs currently used were initially developed for managing type 2 diabetes, making dual or triple agonists an appreciated development in this field.\nSite of Action: Multiple pharmaceutical companies are developing drugs that influence more than one hormone acting on the brain to cause weight loss. Ongoing animal studies show promising results. For instance, Tirzepatide, a drug combining the actions of GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), has shown faster weight loss by stimulating insulin secretion (similar to GLP-1) around mealtime, aiding weight management.\nMuscle Mass: A study on Bimagrumab, an antibody that blocks activin type II receptors and promotes skeletal muscle growth, showed effectiveness in weight loss by reducing adipose tissue while increasing lean mass in obese people with type 2 diabetes. Further research could lead to the development of novel drugs that promote weight loss without sacrificing lean muscle mass."

This \"exercise mimetic\" drug not only increased metabolism but also boosted the mice's endurance, allowing them to run twice as fast. Although still in early stages, this drug shows potential for managing obesity, diabetes, and age-related muscle loss.\nAnother promising drug, SLU-PP-332, is under development. It boosts metabolism without altering food intake, mimicking exercise, or affecting appetite. This drug increases the body's natural metabolism, causing it to expend energy as if running a marathon, resulting in faster fat metabolism and weight loss. Studies in mice showed fat metabolism similar to fasting or exercising, leading to weight loss.\nResearch by Washington University in St. Louis and St. Louis University focuses on a drug that activates energy expenditure pathways. This involves targeting Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), proteins that are more active during exercise. A drug named SLU-PP-332 was designed to activate ERRs, showing promising results in mice. Mice given this drug ran 70 percent longer than those without it. In obese mice, the drug reduced weight gain by 10 percent and increased weight loss by 12 percent without altering their food intake or exercise levels. The drug also strengthened heart muscles in mice with weak hearts, though this aspect requires further research. So far, the drug has shown no adverse effects. The next phase involves modifying it into an edible tablet and testing it on animals before human trials."

The term \"diet\" originates from the Latin word \"diaeta,\" meaning a way of living. Therefore, individuals concentrating on their diet should prioritize a healthy lifestyle rather than merely aiming for weight loss. This can only be achieved through a comprehensive shift to healthy habits.\n\nPrioritizing a balanced diet with adequate physical activity is an excellent lifestyle change. It not only focuses on weight loss but also helps keep one healthy in the long run. This is possible because the synergistic effects of diet and exercise cause physiological changes within the body. \nWhen the body receives fewer calories than it needs for maintenance (calorie deficit through diet), it begins to utilize stored fat for energy. This is achieved by a process called lipolysis, where fat deposits are broken down and converted to energy. To facilitate this process, support metabolic functions, and reduce inflammation, a diet rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants is advised. Body mass index (BMI) plays a major role in this context, as it provides a measurable indicator to assess and track one's weight category and overall health risks associated with excess body fat. \nExercise complements dietary changes by increasing caloric expenditure and improving metabolic rate. Regular physical activity stimulates muscle growth and maintenance. Exercise also ensures the cells take up glucose for energy, thereby improving insulin sensitivity and curbing the incidence of type 2 diabetes. Exercises, like aerobics or resistance training, also produce endorphins that keep the individual motivated during the weight loss journey."

        "content": "One of the complex tasks is losing weight. However, maintaining weight loss for the long term is even more challenging, as most people often experience relapse after a few years of losing weight. One of the theories behind regaining weight is that most people cut off their calorie intake to lose weight, and over time, this makes their body conditioned to burn fewer calories. Therefore, they start gaining weight after a few months due to a slow calorie-burning rate when they resume their regular diet. Thus, for this reason, healthcare professionals do not recommend rapid weight loss and an extremely low-calorie diet for a weight loss program. It is usually advised to lose around half or two pounds in a week, along with changing other lifestyle habits for the success of the weight loss program and long-term maintenance of healthy weight loss. \nA few tips to maintain weight loss include:\nStaying consistent with eating and exercising plans even after losing weight to prevent relapse. \nContinue setting goals.\nPractice intuitive and mindful eating.\nTry eating clean, natural, and whole foods.\nStay hydrated.\nHave quality sleep of seven to eight hours.\nManage stress effectively.\nFind support for motivation."
