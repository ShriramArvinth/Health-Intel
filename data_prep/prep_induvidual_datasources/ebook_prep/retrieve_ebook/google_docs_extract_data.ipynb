      "1.1 Overview: What Is Hemophilia?\n",
      "#article/hemophilia\n",
      "Hemophilia is a hereditary disorder of the blood coagulation mechanism in which the body fails to produce sufficient quantities of clotting factors. These proteins play a very important part in the clotting mechanism and, in combination with platelets, help minimize bleeding. Hemophilia is characterized by an abnormally prolonged blood clotting action and is classified as Hemophilia A and Hemophilia B; Hemophilia A is attributable to a deficiency of factor VIII, and Hemophilia B can be linked with a lack of factor IX. This condition will precipitate spontaneous bleeding episodes as well as bleed freely from injuries or other operations, which are real-life threats. In hemophilia, people develop abnormally prolonged bleeding after injuries or operations and can have spontaneous bleeding inside joints and muscles, which can cause them severe health complications in severe cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 Types of Hemophilia\n",
      "#article/hemophilia \n",
      "#article/hemophilia-a\n",
      "#article/hemophilia-b\n",
      "The two main types of hemophilia are:\n",
      "Hemophilia A: The most common type, characterized by a lack of FVIII, a clotting factor in the body’s blood stream. This condition is inherited in the X-linked recessive manne,r which means that the majority of affected individuals are boys and girls who are carriers of the disease do not manifest the disease.\n",
      "Hemophilia B: Otherwise referred to as Christmas disease, this type results from a deficiency in clotting factor IX (FIX). It also presents a similar pattern of inheritance as that of Hemophilia A, this being an X-linked recessive disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is also a form called acquired, and this is acquired later in life through autoimmune reactions that target clots forming factors, and it may not have a family influence.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3 Global Prevalence\n",
      "#article/hemophilia-causes-and-risk-factors\n",
      "#article/current-state-of-hemophilia\n",
      "Hemophilia is a genetic disorder affecting people’s coagulation system and is considered a rare disease that affects the global population. Recent studies show that the prevalence of hemophilia is even greater, and affects about 1.125 million boys in the world, while earlier data reported only about 400,000. This increase calls for better prevention or at least early detection and accommodation of victims to the nearest hemophilia treatment center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimated Cases: Data from both genders show that men and boys account for almost 1.125 million of the population that suffers from hemophilia.\n",
      "Severe Hemophilia: Of these, around 418000 are estimated to have severe hemophilia, and the majority of them have no access to a diagnosis.\n",
      "Prevalence Rates: Here are the prevalence rates per 100000 males:\n",
      "Hemophilia A (all severities): 17\n",
      "Severe Hemophilia A: 6\n",
      "Hemophilia B (all severities): 4\n",

      "The study also provides insights into hemophilia prevalence at birth:\n",
      "Hemophilia A (all severities): 25 per 100,000 male births\n",
      "Severe Hemophilia A: 10 per 100,000 male births\n",
      "Hemophilia B (all severities): 5 per 100,000 male births\n",
      "Severe Hemophilia B: 2 per 100,000 male births.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.5 Regional Insights\n",
      "#article/current-state-of-hemophilia\n",
      "The distribution of hemophilia shows considerable variation across different regions:\n",
      "About 67 percent of such cases are registered in LMICs that are already experiencing a lack of access to healthcare and the availability of treatments.\n",
      "Identifying and managing patients with hemophilia is somewhat better in the more developed countries because of the status of healthcare-supported and available patient registries.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.6 Implications of Findings\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "The updated prevalence data emphasizes several key points:\n",
      "The large difference that exists between the estimated cases and the actual cases suggests that the majority of the people with hemophilia still have no access to diagnosis or treatment.\n",
      "Indeed, identifying the actual levels of the issue makes it possible to allocate better resources while preparing for further treatment.\n",
      "Raising awareness may help enhance efforts to reach out to those who are possibly affected.\n",
      "New studies on the epidemiology of hemophilia highlight the need for improved global health interventions to address this disease, especially in developing nations with poor health systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.7 Importance of Understanding Hemophilia\n",
      "#article/management-of-hemophilia-in-older-adults\n",
      "But the importance of understanding hemophilia cannot be underestimated because of its impact on the health of the people, on public health care, and on the social and psychological well-being of those families where someone has the condition.\n",
      "a. Healthcare Impacts\n",
      "Hemophilia patients have long-term treatment needs primarily concentrated in the supply of clotting factors. The financial implications of this treatment can be considerable:\n",
      "Direct Costs: The annually incurred health care costs for patients with severe forms of hemophilia might lie in the range of $213,874 and $869,940, primarily in view of rearguable prophylactic and treatment of bleeding events.\n",
      "Indirect Costs: Others include reduced working capability as well as frequent truancy due to other issues such as joint erosions and repeated hemorrhage events. Some conditions are associated with costs incurred in purchasing other related services that contribute to the overall economic cost of having them.\n",
      "Access to Care: Several patients, due to various factors constraining them from seeking the necessary treatment, end up worse off due to ill health, especially from developing nations within the low and middle-income group categories.\n",
      "b. Social Impacts\n",
      "Hemophilia can profoundly influence social interactions and relationships:\n",
      "Social Isolation: Being so scared of a possible injury during different activities, people become isolated or even stop participating in sports. This exclusion is most apparent in children and adolescents who may entirely miss social intervention occasions.\n",
      "Stigma and Misunderstanding: Bullying or misunderstanding from friends or society may also add pressure on the families and affect their feelings of embarrassment or anxiety, more so in issues to do with hemophilia.\n",
      "c. Psychological Impacts\n",
      "The chronic nature of hemophilia often results in various mental health challenges:\n",
      "Anxiety and Depression: Bleeding disorders require lifelong management, and thus, individuals with this condition deal with stress and anxiety concerning various bleeding episodes. Data show that an overall development of depressive tendencies exists in hemophiliacs because of the implications of such a disorder.\n",
      "Coping Mechanisms: Patients may come up with mechanisms for handling the illness; however, due to the constant need for treatment, they may easily get exhausted emotionally. This causes a toll on the patients and their families who have to deal with the challenges in the management of the patients.\n",
      "Therefore, there is a need to understand all aspects of hemophilia to help improve the overall goals of the healthcare provision, minimize any stigmatization of those affected, and look into the psychological aspect of their illness. Greater awareness can help lead to better support systems, increased availability of specialist services, and, therefore, a greater quality of life for those with this treatable illness.\n",

      "2.1 In-depth Analysis\n",
      "#article/hemophilia-causes-and-risk-factors\u000b#article/hemophilia-b\u000b#article/hemophilia-a\u000b#article/hemophilia-c\n",
      "Genetic Basis (X-linked Inheritance, Gene Mutations): Hemophilia A and B are typically inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, with their genes (Factor VIII and Factor IX, respectively) located on the X chromosome. The chromosomal composition of males is one X and one Y chromosome (XY), and females have two X chromosomes (XX). Therefore, if a male inherits a mutated X chromosome from his parent, they will express hemophilia due to the lack of another X chromosome to compensate for the genetically mutated one. However, in females, if a carrier has only one mutated X chromosome and the other one is normal, they are less likely to express severe symptoms of hemophilia, unless both X chromosomes are mutated. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, hemophilia C, unlike the other two (A and B), is caused by a genetic mutation in the Factor XI gene that encodes clotting Factor XI. Further, this gene is present/located on chromosome IV, not the X chromosome, and its inheritance pattern is autosomal recessive. This type of inheritance pattern requires the person to have one mutated gene from each parent (one defective gene from both parents) to express hemophilia, and it can affect both males and females because it is not linked to the X chromosome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Molecular Mechanisms of Hemophilia A, B, and C: The molecular mechanisms of hemophilia A, B, and C are primarily related to the genes encoding the clotting factors VIII, IX, and XI, respectively. \n",
      "In hemophilia A, coagulation Factor VIII (F8) is a cofactor for Factor IX (F9), which activates Factor X (F10) to Xa in the presence of Factor VIIa, leading to the generation of thrombin and the formation of fibrin. Factor VIII is present, is released from the liver into the system in an inactive form, and needs thrombin for activation. Therefore, dysfunction or deficiency of Factor VIII can cause impairment in the generation of thrombin, further causing prolonged bleeding time and poor clot formation.\n",
      "In hemophilia B, Factor IX is also released from the liver and requires Factor VIII for activation to function through an extrinsic pathway. After activation, factor IX forms a complex along with Factor VIIIa, which further activates Factor X, thus leading to the generation of thrombin and boosting clot formation. Therefore, the deficiency of Factor IX also causes prolonged bleeding time and impaired or delayed clot formation.\n",
      "In hemophilia C, the production of Factor XI takes place in the liver, which gets activated by thrombin or collagen, a negatively charged surface. This activation of Factor XI eventually leads to the generation of thrombin and clot formation through an intrinsic pathway. Therefore, dysfunction or deficiency of Factor XI, which is a rarer and milder condition than the other two types (A and B), can lead to hemophilia C. However, bleeding can also occur in hemophilia C, but it is usually less severe than in A and B due to alternative pathways present for clot formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Gene Variants and Mutations\n",
      "#article/hemophilia-b\u000b#article/hemophilia-c\u000b#article/hemophilia-causes-and-risk-factors\n",
      "a. Technical Breakdown of Genetic Abnormalities: It primarily focuses on the various types of genetic mutations in hemophilia, the specific types of genes involved, and their effect on the functioning of the clotting factor. These are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of Mutations in Hemophilia:\n",
      "Point Mutations: These are changes or mutations in the DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) sequence of the Factors VIII, IX, and XI genes at a single base, and they have various effects based on their location within the genes:\n",
      "Missense Mutations - A single nucleotide change in the Factors VIII, IX, and XI protein leads to substituting one amino acid and significantly alters its function. These types of mutations are usually associated with mild to moderate forms of hemophilia A, B, and C. These mutations also cause structural abnormalities and reduced activity of these proteins, and affect the ability of these factors to promote clot formation.\n",
      "Nonsense Mutations - In these mutations, a premature stop codon is formed due to a single nucleotide change, further leading to the truncation of the Factors VIII, IX, and XI proteins. This usually causes a severe reduction in the clotting activity of these proteins and leads to severe hemophilia A, B, and C.\n",
      "Deletions:\n",
      "Small Deletions - This severely disrupts the gene’s coding sequence due to the removal of a few nucleotides, which often leads to non-functional Factors VIII, IX, and XI proteins.\n",
      "Large deletions - These are linked with severe hemophilia A, B, and C as they involve the total loss of large sections of the Factor VIII, IX, and XI genes due to the absence of functional Factor VIII, IX, and XI.\n",
      "Inversion Mutations:\n",
      "Intron 22 Inversion - This is the most common type of mutation that is linked with a severe form of hemophilia A. The mutation leads to disruption in the normal sequence and function of the Factor VIII gene by causing certain rearrangements within the gene (Factor VIII).\n",
      "Intron 1 Inversion - These mutations interfere with the Factor VIII gene transcription and cause a severe form of hemophilia. These are usually less common types of mutations than intron 22 inversion.\n",
      "Insertions and Frameshift Mutations:\n",
      "Insertions: These types of mutations can cause frameshift mutations by inserting one or more nucleotides, which leads to alteration in the reading frame of Factor VIII, IX, and XI genes, and further leads to non-functional or aberrant proteins (8,9, and 11).\n",
      "Frameshift Mutations - These mutations lead to a shift in the reading frame of the genes and cause completely defective or truncated Factors VIII, IX, and XI proteins by causing insertions and deletions that are not multiples of three.\n",
      "Splice Site Mutations:\n",
      "These mutations interfere with the normal splicing of mRNA precursors, that is, at the junctions where the exons and introns of the gene meet, which leads to faulty mRNA and results in the non-functional Factors VII, IX, and XI proteins production.\n",
      "Polymorphism: It occurs in the non-coding regions and affects mRNA, splicing, and gene regulation, and in coding regions, leading to alterations in the protein structure. Therefore, in hemophilia A, this type of mutation changes the residual activity of Factor XI and may also interact with environmental and genetic factors that increase bleeding risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "b. How do Different Mutations Affect the Severity of the Condition?\n",
      "Various mutations that occur in hemophilia potentially affect its severity by having a direct influence on the quantity and function of the coagulation or clotting factor involved. Therefore, the various types of genetic mutations affect the severity of hemophilia  A, B, and C in the following ways:\n",

      "b. Factor Deficiency Pathways: The coagulation cascade comprises three pathways: intrinsic, extrinsic, and common. Among these intrinsic pathways are those considered deficient in hemophilia because they lack Factor VIII  or IX, which are mainly responsible for proper clot formation. The pathway is as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Intrinsic Pathway:  The intrinsic pathway is initiated by damage caused to the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels, which exposes subendothelial collagen and triggers the activation of several clotting factors. The intrinsic pathway also involves various key clotting factors, such as Factor VIII and Factor IX which work together in a sequence. Factor XII is activated by contact with damaged tissue, and activated Factor XII (XIIa) activates Factor XI, which in turn activates Factor IX. Further, activated Factor IXa (factor IX) binds with activated Factor VIIIa (factor VIII) to form a complex called the tenase complex, which in turn activates Factor X, leading to a common pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the lack of Factor VIII (Hemophilia A) or Factor IX (Hemophilia B) interrupts this gene sequence and thus prevents the formation of the tenase complex. Moreover, Factor X cannot be efficiently activated without this complex, which results in the poor generation of thrombin and impaired clot formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extrinsic Pathway: External trauma triggers this pathway, which leads to tissue damage. It is initiated by the release of Tissue Factor (TF) from damaged cells, which then activates Factor VII. Activated Factor VIIa, along with TF, activates Factor X to initiate the common pathway. The extrinsic pathway does have a direct effect on hemophilia as it involves the intrinsic pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "Common Pathway: At the activation of Factor X, both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways converge. Therefore, activated Factor X (Xa) converts prothrombin into thrombin, which then converts fibrinogen into fibrin, which forms the meshwork of a stable blood clot. Since the intrinsic pathway is deficient in hemophilia, the activation of Factor X through the intrinsic pathway is greatly impaired, which leads to reduced thrombin formation and improper clot formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.4 Current Research\n",
      "#article/past-present-and-future-of-hemophilia\n",
      "Gene therapy is a one-time treatment goal to eliminate and replace the faulty gene and deliver a working gene into the liver cells to guide the production of a defective or missing clotting factor. Recent advancements in gene therapy for hemophilia have shown potentially effective outcomes, especially in hemophilia A and B, by addressing the underlying genetic defects, thus reducing the bleeding risk and also improving the quality of life of people suffering from this condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "A recent 2024 study trial of Beaver/Fidanacogene Elaparvovec revealed that single-dose gene therapy for hemophilia B could potentially reduce the bleeding risk in adults by up to 71 percent. The therapy is designed to enable Factor IX production in patients with a deficiency of this gene by delivering modified genes to the liver. This therapy has provided a one-time treatment regimen for multiple bleeding episodes in hemophilia B and a potential shift from multiple infusions of clotting factor to treat the condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another clinical trial on Giroctocogene fitelparvovec, an AAV6-based gene therapy for hemophilia A, demonstrated promising and sustained increases in Factor VIII activity among treated individuals. Over a 104-week follow-up period, participants maintained sufficiently high Factor VIII levels to significantly reduce or even eliminate bleeding episodes, positioning this therapy as a potential one-time treatment option for hemophilia A.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent years, gene therapy and bio-engineered hemostatic molecules have revolutionized treatment for people with hemophilia. These innovative therapies aim to decrease treatment burden and improve patient quality of life. These gene therapies for hemophilia, though significantly effective for improving patients’ quality of life, are still under long-term investigation and clinical follow-up to overcome certain associated challenges, such as the adverse effects of increased liver enzymes and the viral vector’s immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gene Therapy: CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is not yet approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) for hemophilia. However, this is a potential gene-editing technology that allows experts to edit and modify the patient's DNA in a very efficient and precise manner. The key components of CRISPR are the CRISPR sequence (derived from the viruses’ DNA that has been attacked by the bacteria) and the Cas9 protein (a molecular scissors to cut DNA at specific locations). CRISPR aims to improve the production and function of defective or missing clotting by either correcting the clotting factors or replacing them with healthy ones. Though it is a revolutionary genetic therapy for hemophilia, it has not been tested yet on any person suffering from this condition. In 2015, a two-step gene therapy for hemophilia A based on CRISPR/Cas9 was developed by a joint venture between CRISPR Therapeutics and Bayer. The therapy first used a viral vector to deliver a healthy copy of the Factor VIII gene, followed by the delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 components to integrate with the healthy gene into liver cells, which are the primary producers of clotting factors in the body. The approach or study had shown promising results in a mouse model of hemophilia A. \n",
      "Lentiviral Gene Therapy for Hemophilia A: A study published in December 2024 demonstrated that using lentiviral vectors to transduce autologous hematopoietic stem cells resulted in stable factor VIII expression in patients with hemophilia A. This approach offers a potential long-term therapeutic solution by addressing the genetic basis of the disorder.\n",

      "The clinical presentation of hemophilia varies among the different types of hemophilia. \n",
      "\n",
      "a. Hemophilia A   \n",
      "This is the most common form of hemophilia that is caused by reduced levels of factor VIII. Hemophilia A has three variants depending on the level of clotting factor VIII in the blood. They are mild, moderate, and severe.         \n",
      "\n",
      "Mild Hemophilia A (5-40% of normal Factor VIII levels):\n",
      "The symptoms of mild hemophilia A become apparent only after a major invasive procedure or surgery is done. There would be unstoppable bleeding, and that would be the first sign for the diagnosis of mild hemophilia A.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Moderate Hemophilia A (1-5% of normal Factor VIII levels):\n",
      "The most common symptom in moderate hemophilia A is spontaneous bleeding, especially into the joints (hemarthrosis). Chronic bleeding within the joints can lead to significant joint damage (hemophilic arthropathy). Even with minor surgeries or trauma, people with moderate hemophilia A tend to experience prolonged bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Severe Hemophilia A (Less Than 1% of Normal Factor VIII Levels):\n",
      "Spontaneous bleeding even without any trauma into the muscles, joints, and cavities in the body can result due to severe deficiency of factor VIII levels in the blood. Prolonged internal and external bleeding can be life-threatening and should be managed immediately.   \n",
      "\n",
      "b. Hemophilia B    \n",
      "Hemophilia B, commonly known as the Christmas disease, is due to reduced factor IX levels in the blood. The symptoms of hemophilia B are also very similar to hemophilia A. \n",
      "Mild Hemophilia B (5-40% of normal Factor IX levels):\n",
      "Bleeding episodes typically occur only after surgery or major trauma. It may go undetected unless the affected person undergoes a specific diagnostic test.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moderate Hemophilia B (1-5% of normal Factor IX levels):   \n",
      "Symptoms of moderate hemophilia B are occasional spontaneous bleeding, primarily into joints and muscles, as well as delayed or prolonged bleeding after injuries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Severe Hemophilia B (Less than 1% of Normal Factor IX Levels):\n",
      "Spontaneous bleeding episodes occur very frequently, often even in the absence of any trauma. Joint and muscle bleeding is particularly common, leading to long-term complications like joint deformities and disabilities. Internal bleeding, like intracranial hemorrhage (bleeding within the cranium) or intra-abdominal hemorrhage (bleeding within the gut) are common complication and medical emergency associated with severe hemophilia and should be addressed immediately.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Hemophilia C\n",
      "Hemophilia C, or Rosenthal disease, is much rarer than the other forms of hemophilia and causes reduced levels of factor XI in the blood. The symptoms of hemophilia C differ from other forms. They are:\n",
      "Bleeding after a major trauma or surgery, like a dental extraction. \n",
      "There is no significant internal bleeding or bleeding into joint and muscle spaces, unlike hemophilia A and B.\n",
      "Bleeding may be noted in the mucosal structures, like the nose (epistaxis).\n",
      "Individuals may also notice blood in the urine and easy bruising.\n",

      "a. Pediatric Patients:\n",
      "As a child grows, the symptoms of hemophilia may present during the different developmental stages. \n",
      "The first sign of hemophilia will be noted when the baby is given the first dose of vaccination. Bleeding may be prolonged after vaccination.\n",
      "As the baby begins to walk or crawl, there may be bruising.\n",
      "As and when the baby crawls and involves more movements, there may be bleeding within the joints (hemarthrosis).\n",
      "When the teething begins, there may be excessive bleeding within the mouth and gums. \n",
      "Around the age of two or three years, the children may have visible symptoms of joint damage, especially in the weight-bearing joints like the knee, ankles, or waist.\n",
      "Bleeding within the joints can limit the movements of the baby.\n",
      "Muscle hematomas may also occur due to trauma, surgeries, or injections.\n",
      "Internal bleeding within the cranium is the most common presentation in children with severe hemophilia.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Adult Patients:\n",
      "Chronic bleeding episodes in adults can cause severe complications and thus have different presentations when compared to children.\n",
      "Repeated bleeding into the joints can predispose hemophilic adults to develop joint damage called hemophilic arthropathy. This manifests as stiffness in the joints along with pain and limitations in the mobility of the involved joints. The pain may become so intense that there would be a strict necessity for analgesics or replacement of the joints.\n",
      "Internal bleeding is more common within the abdominal cavity and into deep muscular regions. When there are associated comorbidities like hypertension or atherosclerosis, the risk of spontaneous internal bleeding is even more pronounced.\n",
      "Hemophilia also makes patients more prone to develop cardiovascular diseases, as the ability to clot is greatly impaired. \n",
      "\n",
      "\tAssociated Comorbidities:\n",
      "Since hemophilic patients are afraid of their bleeding episodes, they do not indulge in any kind of physical activity. This increases the chance of developing obesity and associated comorbidities like cardiovascular diseases or metabolic diseases.\n",
      "Hemophilia patients tend to use corticosteroids or get repeated infusions of the deficient clotting factors. This can cause osteoporosis (deficit quality of bone) and scars in the veins.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.3 Diagnosis of Hemophilia\n",
      "#article/hemophilia-diagnosis-and-screening\n",
      "When a person is suspected of having hemophilia due to prolonged bleeding episodes (generally more than 8 minutes), several tests are advised. Clinical physical examination is done to look for signs of petechiae or purpura (bleeding spots under the skin), which are classic signs of hemophilia. The standard tests for hemophilia include:\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Clotting Factors Assays:\n",
      "Since hemophilia is a disease that manifests due to a deficit in clotting factors, assays to measure the deficient clotting factors will be the first investigative step. These tests measure the activity level of specific clotting factors in the blood, particularly Factor VIII (for Hemophilia A), IX (for Hemophilia B), and XI (for Hemophilia C). The severity of hemophilia is classified based on the percentage of normal clotting factor present in the blood:\n",
      "Mild Hemophilia: 5-40% of normal clotting factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moderate Hemophilia: 1-5% of normal clotting factor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Severe Hemophilia: Less than 1% of normal clotting factor.\n",
      "To perform this assay, blood drawn from affected patients will be sent to the laboratory, where specific reagents will be added to identify the deficient clotting factors and, accordingly, the diagnosis will be made. Such clotting factor assays are the confirmatory tests for hemophilia diagnosis. \n",
      "\n",
      "b. Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT):\n",
      "This test measures the time taken for the blood to form a clot. Calcium and phospholipid reagents will be added to the test sample to identify the time taken for blood clot formation. It gives an overview of the integrity of the intrinsic and common pathways of coagulation. The normal aPTT time is 30 to 40 seconds, and a prolonged time can indicate hemophilia. However, prolonged aPTT is not just caused by hemophilia. It can be caused by other factors like thrombocytopenia, as well. Thus, correlating the values of aPTT along with the test results of clotting factor assays is necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prothrombin Time:\n",
      "Prothrombin time is the test that measures how quickly blood takes to clots. This exclusively assesses the extrinsic and common pathways of coagulation that do not involve factors VIII, IX, or XI. Thus, hemophilia patients are known to have normal prothrombin time. The normal prothrombin time is 9 to 13 seconds. This test can differentiate hemophilia from other bleeding disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic Testing:\n",
      "Testing for the mutation causing hemophilia is necessary. In Hemophilia A, the most common genetic mutation is an inversion of intron 22 in the F8 gene. In Hemophilia B, mutations in the F9 gene are responsible for the deficiency of Factor IX. Such genetic testing is also necessary to identify carriers of the mutated gene for hemophilia. Genetic testing can also help provide counseling to carrier parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Von Willebrand Factor Test: \n",
      "Von Willebrand disease mimics hemophilia, and when the aPTT is prolonged and the levels of clotting factors are near the normal range, physicians may advise a von Willebrand factor test to rule out the possibility of von Willebrand disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "Clot Waveform Analysis: \n",
      "Recent advancements have introduced modified CWAs, such as CWA-diluted Prothrombin Time (CWA-dPT), CWA-small amount of tissue-factor induced FIX activation assay (CWA-sTF/FIXa), and Clot Fibrinolysis Waveform Analysis (CFWA). These innovations have expanded CWA's clinical applications, enabling the assessment of hypercoagulability, thrombin burst, and fibrinolysis. Consequently, CWA has become a valuable tool in diagnosing and monitoring various coagulation disorders, including hemophilia.\n",

      "3.4 Importance of Prenatal Testing and Screening of Newborns:\n",
      "#article/hemophilia\n",
      "#article/hemophilia-in-pregnancy\n",
      "#article/hemophilia-diagnosis-and-screening\n",
      "Families who have a known history of hemophilia are always advised to undergo prenatal testing and other screening procedures for the newborn to help in the early detection of hemophilia.\n",
      "Prenatal Testing: \n",
      "Prenatal testing of hemophilia is done through two methods: Chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis. Chorionic villus sampling is performed between 10 and 12 weeks of pregnancy, and a small tissue sample of the placenta is tested for mutations in the DNA. Amniocentesis is performed later during the 15th week of gestation. In this procedure, a small portion of the amniotic fluid (fluid surrounding the fetus) is extracted, and the DNA mutations are checked. Such prenatal testing provides a confirmatory diagnosis of whether the fetus has inherited hemophilia or not. This can make the doctors and the parents prepare for delivery with all the necessary precautionary measures and the appropriate care needed post-delivery of the baby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Newborn Screening: \n",
      "Unless there is a history of hemophilia in the family, screening of newborns is not done for hemophilia. Newborn screening is done in cases where there is excessive bleeding from the umbilical stump or easy bruising following birth. Clotting factor assays will be performed to diagnose hemophilia in the newborn. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.5 Challenges in Diagnosis:\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "Challenges in the diagnosis of hemophilia occur due to the delayed presentation of the clinical symptoms. In patients with mild or moderate hemophilia, the symptoms appear only after a trauma or surgical procedure. This can cause a significant setback in the diagnostic processes. Failure to diagnose this condition at an early stage can also make individuals susceptible to developing life-threatening conditions due to prolonged internal bleeding and loss of blood volume. Thus, patients with a family history of hemophilia should be tested as early as possible to rule out the possibility of any variant of hemophilia. Hemophilia A, an X-linked disorder resulting from factor VIII deficiency, poses significant diagnostic challenges in neonates, particularly those born prematurely, due to the physiological immaturity of their coagulation systems and the potential overlap with other neonatal bleeding conditions. Recent advocacy is for the integration of early prophylactic treatment with Emicizumab into clinical guidelines for neonatal hemophilia A management, particularly in premature infants, to mitigate life-threatening complications such as intracranial hemorrhage.\n",

      "a. Replacement Therapy:\n",
      "Hemophilia treatment is focused on restoring the deficient clotting factors in the blood. Thus, the main treatment plan is replacement therapy, in which the deficient clotting factors will be infused into the affected patient’s blood. For this purpose, there are two types of replacement therapy available - plasma-derived and recombinant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plasma-Derived Clotting Factors:\n",
      "Clotting factors will be derived from the plasma (liquid portion of the blood) from a healthy donor’s blood. The donor’s blood will be thoroughly screened for any kind of infections or the presence of autoimmune antibodies before deriving the clotting factors. The plasma will then be processed rigorously to get rid of any contaminants or viruses. This technique of using healthy donors’ blood to derive clotting factors has been used for many years. However, the risk of transmission of infections is always a possibility with this method. \n",
      "\n",
      "Recombinant Clotting Factors:\n",
      "Genetic engineering techniques have paved the way for developing clotting factors in laboratories. Without the use of human blood, the genes necessary for the synthesis of clotting factors will be produced in cells. These cells will be cultured, and the necessary clotting factor will be produced within the laboratories. This will then be purified for use in therapeutics. These synthetically produced recombinant clotting factors are safer as they completely prevent the possibility of transmission of blood-borne infections.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both types of clotting factors have proven effective in managing bleeding episodes and preventing long-term joint damage. However, recombinant factors are now the preferred treatment, especially for younger patients or those newly diagnosed with hemophilia, due to their higher safety profile.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Infusion:\n",
      "Replacement therapy focuses on infusing factor VIII for hemophilia A patients and factor IX for hemophilia B patients. Unlike hemophilia A and hemophilia B, patients with hemophilia C do not require regular infusions but require them only on demand (during surgeries) as the bleeding episodes are less severe.\n",
      "Factor VIII Infusion: The frequency of infusion of factor VIII for hemophilia A patients depends on the level of existing normal clotting factor in the blood. In severe cases, patients may require regular prophylactic infusions (usually two or three times per week) to prevent spontaneous bleeds.\n",
      "Factor IX Infusion: Factor IX is known to have a longer half-life when compared to factor VIII. Hence, the frequency of infusion of factor IX is less. Thus, it is infused only once or twice a week. The bleeding episodes following infusion of factor IX will be markedly reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent days, extended half-life (EHL) clotting factors have been available for infusions. This will help in reducing the frequency of infusion to the patients. \n",
      "\n",
      "|Hemophilia Type | Clotting Factor Deficiency | On-demand Infusion Frequency | Prophylactic Infusion Frequency|\n",

      "4.2: Role of Comprehensive Care Models for Hemophilia Patients\n",
      "#article/aftercare-and-management-of-hemophilia\n",
      "To aid in the comprehensive management of hemophilia, hemophilia treatment centers (HTCs) play a significant role. Such centers aim to provide a multidisciplinary approach to handling hemophilic patients, and they are comprised of specialists in pathology, hematology, orthopedicians, and physical therapists who can provide all-inclusive care for the affected patients. \n",
      "The role of hemophilia treatment centers begins with the preventive aspect of the disease. They provide preventive care to help the patients avoid any complications and also aid in managing spontaneous bleeding episodes. \n",
      "They provide education about the disease to the affected and their families to help in making them understand the pathogenesis of the disease. This can help them manage any emergencies with the utmost care. They also educate the family members about the infusion of clotting factors. \n",
      "A recent study conducted by the Hemophilia Treatment Center (HTC) at Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc in Brussels, Belgium, and published in Blood Advances, highlights the importance of systematically updating family pedigrees to identify potential and obligate carriers of hemophilia A and B. Over a two-year period, researchers analyzed the medical records of 287 male patients with hemophilia and seven female patients from 236 families, identifying 900 female relatives. Of these, 454 were confirmed as carriers through genetic testing or identified as obligate carriers based on family relationships, while 118 were determined to be non-carriers. The study underscores the need for proactive and systematic approaches in HTCs to ensure that female relatives of patients with hemophilia are accurately identified and screened, facilitating timely diagnosis and appropriate management.\n",
      "A recent study highlighted in a National Bleeding Disorders Foundation (NBDF) article reveals that bone health screenings at Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs) are infrequent, indicating a significant gap in clinical care for individuals with bleeding disorders. Despite the known increased risk of osteoporosis and low bone mineral density (BMD) among people with hemophilia and von Willebrand disease, the study found that only a small percentage undergo routine bone health assessments. This underscores the need for HTCs to prioritize bone health evaluations and implement standardized screening protocols to prevent and manage bone-related complications in this patient population.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.3 Need for Multidisciplinary Care\n",
      "#article/management-of-hemophilia-in-older-adults\n",
      "Multidisciplinary care is a highly essential component for bleeding disorders like hemophilia, as it tends to affect several physiological systems in the body.\n",
      "Hematologists and pathologists help in identifying the levels of the deficient clotting factors and help in diagnosis and formulation of the treatment plan. \n",
      "Orthopedicians help assess the level and severity of joint disease, as hemophilic arthropathy is a common complication in hemophilia patients. \n",
      "Physiotherapists are needed to reduce the pain associated with chronic joint damage. \n",
      "Psychologists are also a part of the multidisciplinary approach as they help the patients to cope with the pain and face the world without the fear of getting injured.\n",
      "Thus, hemophilia treatment centers make sure that all these specialists are available under the same roof for patients to seek comprehensive care for a better quality of life and management of the disease. \n",

      "#article//antihemophilic-factor-recombinant-porcine-sequence\n",
      "a. Gene Therapy: \n",
      "Gene therapy is the latest management modality being considered for hemophilia. The objective is to replace the mutated gene causing the deficiency of the clotting factors. The mechanism of gene therapy involves delivering the gene responsible for producing the clotting factors through a vector inside the body. The common vector involved is an adeno-associated virus (AAV) that delivers the gene to liver cells, which are the primary source of clotting factor production. \n",
      "Clinical trials involving gene therapy for hemophilia B have shown great results, and in some patients, the need for infusion of factor IX was not necessary.\n",
      "Gene therapy aims to provide a permanent solution for hemophilic patients by making the body synthesize the necessary clotting factors.\n",
      "The major drawback associated with such gene therapy is that some patients may have pre-existing immunity to the viral vectors used in gene therapy, making the treatment less effective or unsuitable for them. Also, there are inconsistencies in the levels of clotting factor production among various patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "b. Non-Factor Therapies:\n",
      "These therapies do not focus on replacing the deficient clotting factors. Instead, their main aim is to curb the associated bleeding episodes and prevent further complications. Such therapies include:\n",
      "Emicizumab: Emicizumab is a bispecific monoclonal antibody that mimics the function of Factor VIII by bridging activated Factor IX and Factor X to help restore the clotting process. It works independently of Factor VIII, making it especially useful for hemophilia A patients who have developed inhibitors (antibodies) against Factor VIII replacement therapy. This drug is given as a subcutaneous injection once a week or every two weeks. The injection of this monoclonal antibody depends on the dosing regimen. This is exclusively given for hemophilia A patients and not for other types of hemophilia.\n",
      "Fitusiran: Fitusiran is an RNA (ribonucleic acid) interference (RNAi) therapy that targets antithrombin, a natural anticoagulant in the blood. By reducing antithrombin levels, Fitusiran aims to rebalance the clotting system, allowing for increased thrombin generation and reduced bleeding episodes without needing direct factor replacement. This is administered through the subcutaneous route once a month and can be given for both hemophilia A and B patients. However, Fitusiran is known to cause thrombosis episodes if the levels of antithrombin are highly reduced in the blood.\n",
      "Concizumab: Concizumab is an antibody that targets tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), another natural inhibitor of clotting. By inhibiting this, Concizumab enhances thrombin generation, improving clot formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. Extended Half-Life Clotting Factors:\n",
      "As mentioned earlier, extended half-life clotting factors are developed to reduce the frequency of infusion for the affected patients. They are exclusively designed to make them stay longer in the blood for effective action. These factors are engineered through either pegylation (attaching polyethylene glycol molecules to the factor) or by fusing the factor to the Fc region of immunoglobulin (IgG), or albumin. These modifications slow down the degradation of the clotting factor in the bloodstream. Eloctate (Factor VIII for hemophilia A) and Alprolix (Factor IX for hemophilia B) are examples of these EHL clotting factor products.\n",
      "\n",
      "d. Immune Tolerance Induction:\n",
      "Some patients with hemophilia (especially hemophilia A) tend to develop inhibitors or antibodies to neutralize the infused clotting factors. This makes the entire replacement therapy less effective. To combat this, immune tolerance induction is used. Patients are given frequent, high doses of clotting factor (often daily infusions) over a prolonged period, which “trains” the immune system to stop producing inhibitors. Once immune tolerance is achieved, the patient can resume standard clotting factor replacement therapy. The objective of this treatment is to eliminate the production of inhibitors or antibodies and restore the effectiveness of standard or conventional replacement therapy.\n",
      "To quantify these inhibitors and also to assess the effectiveness of immune tolerance induction therapy, a gold standard laboratory test is done. This is the Nijmegen-Bethesda Assay. The assay works by mixing the patient's plasma with normal plasma containing the clotting factor and measuring the reduction in clotting activity. Together, immune tolerance induction and the Nijmegen-Bethesda Assay provide a comprehensive approach to managing inhibitor complications in hemophilia patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "E. Gene Editing:\n",
      "Gene editing is the latest advancement in managing hemophilia. It uses tools like CRISPR-Cas9 that can potentially correct the defective gene in patients' DNA, enabling their bodies to produce their clotting factors (Factor VIII or Factor IX) naturally. Hence, this is considered a permanent cure option for hemophilia patients. However, the studies and trials surrounding the use of gene editing tools are very limited and need expansion for better employment. \n",
      "\n",
      "F. Recently Approved Therapies: \n",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Sanofi's Qfitlia, a novel therapy for hemophilia A and B patients aged 12 and older. Administered subcutaneously every two months, Qfitlia offers a less frequent dosing regimen compared to existing treatments, potentially improving patients' quality of life. Clinical trials demonstrated that Qfitlia reduced annualized bleeding rates by 90% compared to control groups. However, the therapy comes with a boxed warning for potential thrombotic events and gallbladder disease, necessitating regular monitoring.\n",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Alhemo (concizumab-mtci) for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with hemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors or hemophilia B with factor IX inhibitors. Alhemo is administered via subcutaneous injection. ​\n",
      "On October 11, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pfizer's HYMPAVZI™ (marstacimab-hncq) for routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce bleeding episodes in adults and pediatric patients aged 12 and older with hemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors or hemophilia B without factor IX inhibitors. Administered once weekly via subcutaneous injection using an auto-injector pen, HYMPAVZI offers a more convenient alternative to traditional intravenous treatments. Approval was based on Phase 3 trial data showing a significant reduction in bleeding episodes. Phil Gattone, CEO of the National Bleeding Disorders Foundation, praised the approval as a meaningful step forward in improving the quality of life for individuals with hemophilia.\n",

      "The psychological impact of living with hemophilia has been described in terms of feelings of depression and worry, frustration, and self-consciousness, which are consistent in people with hemophilia, including those with other bleeding disorders, who reported feeling misunderstood, rejected, or mistreated. Earlier, people with hemophilia have also highlighted other psychological aspects, such as avoiding revealing their disease for fear of being isolated and repelled by society and feeling that hemophilia affects their identity, with constraints in physical activities as a primary reason for their identity challenges. \n",
      "\n",
      "An observational study found that higher anxiety and depressive symptoms are more likely to be associated with more urgent hospital visits due to hemophilia, more bleeding episodes, more affected joints and pain, as well as worse levels of perceived functionality. Therefore, the studies highlighted the need to address the psychological impact of hemophilia on people and the need to develop newer treatment and coping strategies for them as a health equity and a hemophilia-free mind.\n",

      "As for the majority of the patients with hemophilia, it is necessary to live with it, and it means that it can become a combination of physical and psychological or/and social difficulties. This condition’s penetration depends on the psychosocial aspects of human existence, and it encroaches on people of all ages with or without families and caregivers. As described in this overview, coping strategies, some psychological aspects, and social implications of hemophilia are discussed.\n",

      "a. For Children\n",
      "A child with hemophilia cannot take part in a lot of activities, as it is advised that the affected child should lead a sedentary lifestyle to enhance quick clotting; this will make the child feel lonely. To help them cope, several strategies can be beneficial:\n",
      "Peer Support: Fostering peer group connections among children with hemophilia globally can enhance a sense of belonging and reduce loneliness. This supportive environment encourages children to share their challenges and celebrate achievements, promoting emotional resilience and building a network of mutual understanding.\n",
      "Education: Providing children with comprehensive knowledge about hemophilia empowers them to understand and manage their condition more confidently. This awareness reduces anxiety and dispels fears, enabling them to participate in decisions about their health and care. Education about hemophilia promotes prevention, encourages positive behavioral changes, and fosters a proactive approach to managing the disorder.\n",
      "b. For Adults\n",
      "Some of the core problems we found reported in the adult patient were chronic pain and restricted mobility, which can cause anxiety and likely depression. Effective coping strategies for adults include:\n",
      "Therapeutic Interventions: Psycho-social interventions like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) have demonstrated cost-effective gains in mental health. It assists a person in identifying ways of handling different states of affairs, as well as changing attitudes and regulating feelings.\n",
      "Support Networks: Two of the most critical resources for a support system among people with the same experiences are friends who may help provide caring and advice. Group support can provide the medium through which to present the struggles and receive support and acknowledgement, as well as the opportunity to review progress, which can add much to one’s quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "c. For Caregivers\n",
      "\n",
      "It is helpful that individuals with hemophilia have caregivers since it is a major challenge caring for such patients, yet this comes with immense stress and pressure. Strategies to support caregivers include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Self-Care: It must also be understood that attachment figures have to be well to take care of their ward. This way, they could listen to music, read books, go for a jog, swim, work on other interests, or just get plenty of rest, and they also help others.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professional Support: Thus, the caregivers may find it beneficial to seek therapy or to become members of the groups that are dedicated to the situation described. It is important for individuals to express their emotions and problems to other people who can listen and help because feelings of loneliness are lessened, and possible ways to solve difficulties are increased. \n",

      "\n",
      "The social and mental effects of hemophilia are significant. Data shows that people suffering from this disorder are more likely to develop mental problems, including depression and anxiety. These problems are more frequent than in the general population, as mentioned above.\n",
      "\n",
      "a. Mental Health Management\n",
      "\n",
      "To effectively address these mental health concerns, several strategies are recommended:\n",
      "\n",
      "Regular Screening: Screening could help in identifying problems and is well-placed to be done on a scheduled basis within classrooms so that early interventions can be made when needed. Such a strategy can make the necessary corrections to the method of ensuring that, with proper timing, a person gets the needed support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrated Care Models: Physical treatment alongside psychological ones has to be provided to be effective. It will also be the study of biomedicine to augment the intentional analysis of the physical and mental health of patients with hemophilia at the same time to get a better therapeutic result. \n",
      "b. Social Stigma and Challenges\n",
      "Navigating Misconceptions:\n",
      "Societal prejudice and fears of people with hemophilia are normally shaped by ignorance and poor information on the nature of the illness. Common misconceptions include:\n",
      "Perception of Weakness: In particular, the stigma associated with disability and peculiarities of character leads to socially excluded and discriminated individuals with hemophilia. This stereotype may also limit the individuals’ and their careers’ prospects, as well as make the isolation worse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of Awareness: While some can be grossly insensitive, many people are just ignorant of what it means to be a hemophiliac. Awareness of the factual and current life experiences of people with hemophilia is important to gain support in the communities.\n",
      "5.5 Importance of Patient Advocacy And Community Support\u000b#article/strategies-for-handling-hemophilia\n",
      "Alleviating these misconceptions and fighting prejudice cannot happen without initiating endeavors. Non-governmental bodies also exist whose functions are to sensitize the public, advocate for change, and lobby for changes that will improve the lives of affected patients in cases of hemophilia. Other studies also highlight the beneficial significance of support networks for persons and families living with hemophilia.\n",
      "Therefore, the management of psychosocial impacts of hemophilia requires increased employment of coping mechanisms, assertive management of psychological issues, and challenges arising from the stigma of hemophilia so that hemophilia patients and their families realize improved quality of life. Education about, support for, and advocacy of those with hemophilia allows the hemophilia patient to emerge with power and self-determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, coping with hemophilia: Psychosocial, emotional, and social challenges can be overwhelming, but social support, mental health care management, patients’ advocacy, and supportive communities can improve hemophilia-related quality of life for patients and caregivers.\n",

      "Tailored Exercise:\n",
      "Tailored exercises reduce the risk of re-injury. Exercises generally play a vital role in the recovery phase after an injury. However, there is also the risk of getting re-injured. Selecting the wrong form of exercise or intensity can result in re-injury and reverse the recovery process. Tailoring exercise will help the person to properly engage themselves and the injured part during the exercise session, which helps in the recovery process. Research supports the implementation of structured adapted physical activity (APA) programmes to improve functional capacity and joint mobility while reducing kinesiophobia in individuals with haemophilia. Tailored exercise interventions not only enhance physical outcomes but also help address the psychological barriers to movement, promoting overall health and well-being.\n",
      "Holistic Support:\n",

Tailoring exercise will help to benefit mental and physical health. The impact of a multimodal exercise program focusing on balance and strength in individuals with haemophilia. The findings indicate that such programs can lead to significant improvements in both balance and muscular strength, addressing common musculoskeletal impairments associated with the condition.\n",
      "Support in Getting Started:\n",
      "Tailored exercises will help the person gain the knowledge and the information required to get started. This will consider the previous level of activity, health, and the goal of the person that they wish to achieve. Research found that once-weekly comprehensive physiotherapy programs significantly improved joint health, reduced hemarthrosis frequency, alleviated pain, and enhanced muscle strength, range of motion, walking capacity, balance, and visuomotor reaction time. Research suggests that even low-frequency physiotherapy, when combined with regular home exercises, can effectively enhance musculoskeletal health and functional abilities in individuals with hemophilic arthropathy.\n",
      "More Than an Exercise Program:\n",

However, when it comes to hemophilia statistics, there are some surprising elements, and it is these elements that can help you understand how relevant and significant this condition is when viewed from a global perspective. Let us have a look at the distribution of hemophilia around the world so that you can keep yourself updated on the disease burden that it has created on public health. The statistical aspects of hemophilia are different for the two hemophilia subtypes. \n",
      "\n",
      "8.1 Global Statistics and Epidemiology\n",
      "#article/hemophilia-causes-and-risk-factors\n",
      "#article/current-state-of-hemophilia\n",
      "Prevalence: The prevalence of hemophilia A is much higher than that of hemophilia B, and that is the reason why hemophilia A is considered to be more common. For every 5000 male births, one can have hemophilia A, while for hemophilia B, it is one in 30,000 male births. This is the global prevalence for the two hemophilia types. But when we look into each geographical area, the prevalence does vary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Distribution: The distribution of hemophilia is not uniform across the world. Some countries have a higher distribution while others do not. So, there might be some factors that could influence the distribution as well as the prevalence of the condition. Similarly, the distribution is more specific to populations of Northern European descent. The distribution of disease is influenced by the availability and accessibility of diagnostic facilities, as regions with better access to these services often report higher rates of diagnosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia are the countries where the distribution of hemophilia is estimated to be the highest. Hemophilia prevalence in these regions ranges between one in 4000 to one in 5000 male births. Asia, Latin America, and Africa show a lesser hemophilia distribution. However, that is not completely because of the lower hemophilia prevalence in these regions, but it could be due to underdiagnosis and underreporting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Underreporting: Accurate global statistical data are not available for hemophilia. Though surveys are periodically conducted to analyze the distribution, only a part of the independence and prevalence come into the picture. Why does this happen? A significant number of people with hemophilia remain undiagnosed and unaware of their condition, allowing the disease to persist undetected and untreated.\n",
      "\n",
      "As per the statistical reports set out by the World Federation of Hemophilia, there could be more than 1.1 million hemophilic individuals; however, the incidence and prevalence do not seem to match with these statistics, and it was found that a large part of the hemophilia-affected individuals are unaware of the fact that they are hemophilic. \n",
      "\n",
      "The diagnosis of hemophilia is often connected with the country’s economic background; to be more precise, a high-income country has a better hemophilia diagnosis, which is close to 100 percent. At the same time, disease identification is often below 12 percent in low-income countries. This disparity and difference in hemophilia reporting are mainly because of the inaccessibility to diagnostic care and the absence of a proper tracking system in low-income countries. Since high-income countries are more equipped with such provisions and arrangements, hemophilia diagnosis, disease reporting, and tracking can be accurately carried out. For the same reason, the disease outcome also differs in high-income and low-income countries. The maintenance of the patient registry is essential for statistical analysis of the disease. \n",
      "\n",
      "8.2 Access to Care\n",
      "#article/current-state-of-hemophilia\n",
      "Access to care for hemophilia is another important aspect that needs to be explored further. Though the treatment scopes and prognosis have increased with advanced therapies for hemophilia, ensuring access to care for everyone is still questionable. The advanced treatment has enhanced longevity and reduced both mortality and morbidity associated with it. It also enables the patient to have a healthier and fuller life with a reduced disease burden. However, accessibility and affordability are the key limiting factors when considering hemophilia treatments. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hemophilia treatment often requires significant financial support, as the advanced treatments that offer better prognoses are costlier for the patient and could financially burden the patient. The high cost of these treatments may, by default, limit the accessibility to hemophilia treatment for all socioeconomic classes of patients. Middle-class and lower-middle-class patients may often find it difficult to access such expensive treatments, and for them, hemophilia treatment expenditure can be quite overwhelming and unbearable. \n",
      "\n",
      "8.3 Challenges in Low-Income vs. High-Income Countries\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "Not only the individual’s financial status but also the country’s economic background influences the accessibility of hemophilia treatments. However, both high-income and low-income countries have their challenges concerning access to care for hemophilia. Now, let us have a look at those challenges and issues:\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-income countries do not have many diagnostic and advanced treatment provisions for hemophilia patients. This inadequacy in the availability of such diagnostic facilities is the main reason for underreporting, and that is why there is a greater probability of undiagnosed cases in low-income countries. Similarly, advanced hemophilia treatments that offer promising outcomes are also not made available in most healthcare settings in low-income countries. So, even if hemophilia is diagnosed, the patient would neither have access to life-saving hemophilia therapies nor high-quality treatment care. \n",
      "\n",
      "In high-income countries, the situation is quite different; there are better treatment options and better diagnostic facilities that are available. Despite treatment availability, many, particularly from lower financial backgrounds, still do not have access to these treatments, which are higher in cost. Similarly, if the person is from a rural place, even though it's a high-income country, specific hemophilia treatment centers might not be within their reach, which can also pose challenges in accessing the care that is needed for them. \n",
      "\n",
      "In low-income countries, the individuals’ general awareness of the condition is relatively low, and many still hold on to misconceptions and social taboos. This may restrict the person from getting diagnosed and taking up the right treatment measures. \n",
      "The general population in high-income countries is more aware and equipped with medical information, so they might have a better idea of the seriousness of their medical issues. That is why more cases are reported in high-income countries, but the worry of their illness, incessant treatment, and financial draining can destroy their peace of mind and may, over time, lead to mental health issues. \n",
      "\n",
      "8.4 Successful Global Programs and Interventions\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "In order to counter the challenges in accessing care for hemophilia patients, several global initiatives and programs were introduced. These programs were often carried out by the integrated and collaborative functioning of the governmental organization and health care system in that country. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several generic alternatives that can replace expensive hemophilia medicines were also introduced as an initiative to reduce the financial burden, thereby making the treatment accessible to all classes of people. These generic medicines have efficacy equivalent to or comparable to that of the standard medicines, which are often expensive. \n",
      "\n",
      "To create and increase awareness of hemophilia among the general population and to eradicate the taboos and stigma that exist in connection with it, patient advocacy groups have been introduced. In addition, both educational and social media platforms are also used for creating awareness regarding the impact that hemophilia can have on the patient’s life and the importance of the right treatment. \n",
      "\n",
      "To support developing low-income countries, initiatives like project SHARE (Supplying Hemophilia Aid and Relief) are launched. Through this SHARE project, clotting factors, which are critical for hemophilia treatment, are supplied to low-income countries where the availability of these life-saving factors is minimal. The project SHARE has significantly contributed to enhancing the accessibility to hemophilia treatment and care. It is a combined initiative of the government and non-governmental organizations. \n",

      "Patient advocacy and community support are important factors in the lives of individuals with hemophilia. They create ways for patients to get the care they need, help raise awareness of the disease, and create support groups for patients and their loved ones. Most advocacy organizations and support groups operate cohesively to guarantee that patients are provided with the necessary resources and support to lead meaningful lives. \n",
      "9.1 Role of Advocacy Organizations\u000b#article/no - article\n",
      "Patient advocacy organizations play a critical role in securing treatment access, education, and policy changes favoring the hemophilia community. Two major organizations currently operating at global and national levels are the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) and the Hemophilia Federation of America (HFA).\n",
      "9.2 World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) \u000b#article/no - article\n",
      "The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) is an international nongovernmental organization established in 1963, and its main activities are to support and facilitate actions designed to improve and maintain the appropriate management of hemophilia and other hereditary bleeding disorders. Instead, it emphasizes the concept of “treatment for all,” meaning that all patients, regardless of their age, gender, or geographical location, should receive the same convenient and prompt diagnosis and treatment. One of the primary functions of WFH is to advocate for improved treatment for patients and to develop benchmarks for treatment internationally for hemophilia. Indeed, the WFH has acted in the hemophilia community in the most significant way by contributing towards the developments in the treatment of hemophilia, the availability of basic medication, and the sensitization of clinicians and society. As an advocate for the rights of patients and their healthcare systems, as well as policymakers, the WFH directs efforts to achieve enhanced health for all and equity in hemophilia care. The roles and activities of WFH as related to advocacy for hemophilia are as follows:\n",
      "WFH is an international organization whose goal is to disseminate information about hemophilia to promote early diagnosis and the subsequent use of appropriate therapy.\n",
      "WFH is an international organization that has been committed to providing medical requirements and other essential commodities to those countries and regions that are still out of access to proper treatment of hemophilia. \n",
      "In addition, WFH works with governments, healthcare institutions, and international organizations as well as advocates for healthcare equality for people the hemophilia and advocating for healthcare financial frameworks. \n",
      "The organization also has patients, families, and the healthcare professional community for many who have hemophilia around the world. \n",
      "WFH supports research and clinical trials and has funded studies on novel treatments that include gene therapy, molecular therapy, and personalized medicine. \n",
      "It makes preliminary interaction of the organization with the healthcare providers for capacity-building among the healthcare workers regarding the treatment and management of hemophilia, enhancing compliance with set standards, as well as putting into practice the best practices of managing the condition.\n",
      "The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) has made a substantial difference in the everyday experience of Adonia Musoke, a Ugandan man who lives with hemophilia. The medical professionals diagnosed and started treating Musoke with factor infusion therapy at first in 2024, brought the inhibitors that were brought his treatment futile end. The WFH Humanitarian Aid Program delivered non-factor replacement therapy to Musoke so he experienced fewer joint pains and no more bleeding emergencies. Musoke obtained stable employment through shop attendance while his support helped enhance all aspects of his daily life. Throughout 2015 to present day, the WFH has provided Uganda with more than 20.3 million International Units (IUs) of clotting factor and, in addition, has donated over 224,000 mg of non-factor replacement therapy to improve care for bleeding disorder patients across the area.\n",
      "The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) launched a new logo combined with visual guidelines to modernize the appearance of World Hemophilia Day 2025 while revitalizing its branding elements. The redesigned elements express both better times ahead and the progressive movement of bleeding disorders groups. The resources exist for direct download to support people and organizations in their awareness campaign work.\n",
      "World Hemophilia Day will organize its 2025 event on April 17 to highlight the importance of treating women and girls with bleeding disorders despite inadequate diagnosis and service provision. The WFH promotes worldwide event participation through shared stories about advocacy work to strengthen its impact.\n",
      "9.3 Hemophilia Federation of America (HFA)\u000b#article/no - article\n",
      "The Hemophilia Federation of America is a national non-profit organization incorporated in 1994 that focuses on helping, informing, and representing the society of bleeding disorders. This is to advocate, educate, and support individuals and their families living with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders. HFA deals with medical and social problems, focusing on their quality of life and their ability to get treatment. It involves legislation and policy, direct services, and education for the patients and families so that they can advocate for their needs. For example, HFA is concerned with supporting the community and helping people with hemophilia to have the company of like-minded people, keeping their mental health, and providing them with financial support and general information. The key roles and activities of HFA in hemophilia advocacy:\n",
      "HFA’s mission is to advocate for hemophilia, and HFA provides materials or data about hemophilia or bleeding disorders to any patient with hemophilia, their families, or any healthcare personnel. \n",
      "HFA provides orientation and sensitization by organizing virtual meetings, training, and sessions among such people. \n",
      "HFA also writes to politicians and other political friends to ensure that people with hemophilia are protected in the sense that they are accorded their rights and basic needs. They play a major role when it comes to the formulation of healthcare policies with state and federal governments on issues related to do with treatment, insurance, and universal healthcare rights. \n",
      "Enhancement and support of patient care are also among HFA objectives; through events like a symposium, the members can meet. \n",
      "HFA also has an available amount of funds for treatment and transport, emergencies, events, and necessities that are involved in the medical field. \n",
      "HFA is prepared to research to meet the population's needs and also to bring about change in therapeutic care. \n",
      "HFA also has other services and programs that work with the psychological profile of patients with hemophilia, including Blood Brotherhood and Blood Sisterhood.\n",
      "9.4 Local and National Support Groups:\u000b#article/management-of-hemophilia-in-older-adults\u000b#article/strategies-for-handling-hemophilia\n",
      "Families with hemophilia end up being socially isolated, and the support groups offer them an opportunity to share what they go through, exchange tips, and also get emotional support. Some of the services provided by local and national support groups include support meetings, educational sessions, and peer support. Local affiliates of national advocacy organizations such as the HFA and NBDF (National Bleeding Disorders Foundation) are often active in organizing events and activities to enable patients and their families to develop strong support networks. These groups are extremely useful in combating the loneliness that comes with many chronic illnesses and also in offering useful tips and tricks that can assist people in the challenges of day-to-day life.\n",
      "Another important function of local support groups is to educate those in their local area about hemophilia. From time to time, these groups coordinate walks, fundraising, and awareness campaigns, which help create awareness when it comes to hemophilia and the current needs of those suffering from the disease. National support groups can serve as a guideline for such activities, most likely as they oversee local initiatives to ensure that they prove useful. They also collaborate with manufacturers, medical facilities, and research agencies to make advanced technologies in care available to the hemophilia community.\n",
      "In August 2024, the Hemophilia Alliance created and funded a session for National Youth Leadership Institute at the National Bleeding Disorders Foundation's (NBDF) Bleeding Disorder Conference. A variety of healthcare professionals at this session explored employment avenues in the bleeding disorders community work. The NYLI organization focuses on individuals between 18 to 24 who work to develop leadership potential and personal transformation for those living with bleeding disorders.\n",

It is often through research and studies that new and novel treatment strategies and therapeutic choices come into existence, offering better health and better lives for the diseased ones among us, and so does hemophilia research. Over the past decade, hemophilia research has witnessed several breakthroughs. It is through these breakthroughs that more sophisticated and promising therapies for hemophilia have emerged. Such breakthrough advancements increase the prognostic aspect of the disease and ensure improved and sustained treatment outcomes. \n",

      "#article/hemophilia-treatment\n",
      "Innovations in treatment are what help improve disease management and, thereby, enhance the disease prognosis by reducing its burden on the patients. Let us have a look at some of the innovations that came into hemophilia treatment:\n",
      "\n",
      "Gene Therapy: Gene therapy is a breakthrough innovation in hemophilia management. It was a complete game changer and has significantly transformed the treatment of hemophilia. Unlike other hemophilia treatments that have to be continued lifelong, gene therapy is a single-sitting therapy. It does not mean that it is less effective; it is not. Rather, it is more effective and is a superior treatment strategy than regular hemophilia therapies like factor infusion. It could even provide better coverage from the excess bleeding episodes that often trouble hemophilia patients. \n",
      "\n",
      "In gene therapy, the gene that is concerned with the expression of the clotting factor whose deficit has caused you hemophilia is introduced into your liver cell. Thus, the delivered gene expresses the clotting factor protein and thereby resolves the deficit. Since this gene is then left inside your body, it functions like an intrinsic gene and keeps on producing the clotting factor for years and years. Hemgenix is the very first gene therapy that was endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration and is specifically indicated for hemophilia B, while for hemophilia A, the FDA-approved one is Roctavian.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It offers a long-term outcome and often serves as curative therapy. Around 90 percent of the bleeding rate reduction can be achieved with gene therapy. In addition, the anticoagulant factor activity also returns to its normal range. However, more evaluation is needed to determine how long the gene therapy could work and its extent of durability.\n",
      "\n",
      "CRISPR: Another innovative treatment approach for hemophilia is CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats). Through the CRISPR technique, the error in the gene, otherwise called a gene mutation, that has caused hemophilia can be corrected. It is an advanced and sophisticated gene editing technique through which an individual’s genes can be modified; it can be done either through deletion, addition, or alteration of a particular gene, such that the disease associated with it can be cured. \n",
      "\n",
      "CRISPR-Cas9 is one such gene editing system that is used in hemophilia patients. This tool removes the faulty gene and repairs it so that the clotting factor deficit that has arisen because of that faulty gene can be completely resolved. It, thus, offers a permanent and lifelong fix for hemophilia. In this technique, first, the gene that is mutated needs to be identified, and then a short RNA (ribonucleic acid) segment that complements the mutated gene segment is created. This particular RNA segment serves as the guide sequence, and hence, it is also called gRNA. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Cas9 enzyme is used in this technique to cut the gene at the intended place, and gRNA is designed such that it could also bind to this enzyme. The gRNA and the Cas9 enzyme system are delivered into the individual’s body, and then the gRNA guides the Cas9 to the intended gene sequence in the liver cell so that it can cut the gene segment at the mutation site and thereby remove the mutation. The cut gene segment is then repaired by either deletion, addition, or replacement of the gene sequences, which is the body’s intrinsic mechanism of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) repair. This is how gene editing through CRISPR works for the correction of hemophilia genes. \n",
      "\n",
      "RNA Interference: RNA interference is yet another promising treatment choice for hemophilia patients. Here, in this technique, a small RNA sequence is used to interfere with and interrupt the messenger RNA (mRNA), and that RNA fragment is also regarded as siRNA (small interfering RNA). Unlike the CRISPR technique, RNA interference does not rectify the mutation; instead, it blocks the activity of the target mRNA, which could translate into a defective protein. So, through RNA interference, the expression of the mutated gene that causes hemophilia can be masked and muted. Thus, the wrong protein that pulls back and reduces the healthy clotting factor production can be eliminated by blocking its mRNA. The pathway that enhances the worsening of hemophilia can be interrupted and blocked by this technique. \n",
      "\n",
      "Latest Clinical Trial Updates: \n",
      "At the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2024, Dr. Steven W. Pipe presented findings from the ATLAS-OLE clinical trial evaluating Fitusiran, an siRNA therapeutic targeting antithrombin, as prophylaxis for individuals with hemophilia A and B. The study introduced bleed management guidelines recommending reduced doses of clotting factors and extended dosing intervals to mitigate thrombotic risks. Dr. Pipe concluded that Fitusiran effectively modulates thrombin generation, allowing for better bleed control with lower doses of clotting agents, thereby enhancing the patient experience.\n",
      "​Sanofi has announced positive results from its Phase 3 LUNA 3 clinical trial evaluating rilzabrutinib, an investigational therapy for adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that 23% of patients treated with rilzabrutinib achieved a durable platelet response, compared to 0% in the placebo group. Additionally, 65% of patients receiving rilzabrutinib achieved the desired platelet response, versus 33% of those on placebo. Secondary endpoints were also met, including reductions in bleeding events, increased duration of platelet response, decreased need for rescue therapy, and improvements in physical fatigue and quality of life measures. These findings suggest that rilzabrutinib may offer a promising new treatment option for individuals with ITP.\n",
      "​Expression Therapeutics recently presented Phase 1 clinical trial results for ET3, their investigational gene therapy for hemophilia A, at the 66th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. Developed using novel lentiviral vectors, ET3 aims to provide a potential treatment option for individuals with hemophilia A.\n",

      "10.2 Potential for a Cure\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "Though there are promising treatment choices for hemophilia, they also possess their drawbacks and challenges. Be it gene therapy, gene editing, or RNA interference technology, everything does come at a certain cost. For example, gene therapy, though it offers promising results, there are chances for our body to exhibit immunological reactions as it involves the use of viral vectors. Similar is the case with gene editing, where the Cas9 enzyme is of bacterial origin. So, the possibility of immunological reactions cannot be overlooked, and apart from that, there are several other concerns, like vector delivery challenges and many more, and that is the reason why more and more research and studies are still ongoing to derive a potential cure for hemophilia. Studies are focusing on measures and techniques to tackle the challenges and reduce the risk factors and adverse outcomes associated with these techniques. We are all hoping that in the near future, these studies may bring out solutions for the drawbacks and challenges associated with these innovative techniques so that patients can have long-term and permanent cures for hemophilia. \n",

      "10.4 Ethical Considerations:\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "Several ethical considerations have arisen up with gene editing technology, and still, it is a debatable topic. Let us glance through some of the ethical concerns associated with gene editing in hemophilia patients:\n",
      "Through gene editing, your genetic makeup can be changed, and these changes can then be transmitted to future generations. So, if the edit occurs in the wrong place, which is not the intended location, then it can lead to alarming health issues like cancer. Those edits also get passed down to subsequent generations, making their offspring prone to those genetic issues that are created due to the off-target effect of gene editing. This is one of the major ethical concerns associated with gene editing.\n",
      "Gene editing is an expensive treatment modality, and therefore, it might only be accessible and affordable to that class of patients who are wealthy enough to take up the cost of the treatment, while the other patient class, the marginalized ones who are not capable to afford this huge treatment cost, will not have access. So, gene editing cannot offer equitable accessibility for all hemophilia patient irrespective of their financial background. \n",
      "There are possibilities for the misuse of this gene editing technology to capture superior qualities in their offspring or future generations by engineering the genome in the way they want. Since the treatment is affordable only to the wealthy class of patients, they might use this technique to get superior cognitive and behavioral qualities.\n",
      "Another ethical concern is with respect to informed consent. Before obtaining informed consent, the person must be well informed of the pros and cons, including the long-term effects. Since gene editing techniques are quite complex, it is often difficult to make a person completely understand the risks and benefits; many times, the person agrees to it without even much comprehension. Similarly, if the patient is a child, then the consent can only be obtained from the parents. If the gene edit is carried out in an embryo, then also obtaining informed consent is not be obtained, and only the parents can make the decision. \n",
      "As part of gene editing, genetic testing might be carried out, and there are chances for that sensitive information to be leaked, and the person might face genetic discrimination. \n",
      "\n",
      "All these ethical considerations and concerns can be resolved and addressed promptly with further advancement in hemophilia research. The treatment must be devised such that the patient’s rights are not breached or disrespected at any point. Another point to consider is that equitable accessibility for hemophilia is there to all hemophilia patients regardless of the financial class to which they belong.\n",
      "\n",
      "Section 11 - Conclusion\n",
      "#article/hemophilia\n",
      "#article/aftercare-and-management-of-hemophilia\n",
      "To conclude, hemophilia is a rare but serious genetic disorder that primarily affects the lives of people diagnosed with it, thus posing various ongoing challenges that require prompt and effective medical care along with lifelong management. The disease also sometimes calls for an increased awareness among people, timely diagnosis, and a proactive treatment approach. Also, advances in medical science, such as in the field of gene therapy, have given new hope to healthcare professionals for reducing the severity of the condition or potentially curing the disease completely, thus paving the way for an improved quality of life for those who suffer from hemophilia. However, currently, effective management of hemophilia still relies on prompt clotting factor replacement therapy and individualized care plans that are tailored to cater to each patient’s specific needs.\n",
      "Additionally, healthcare professionals, family members, and advocacy groups also play an essential role in empowering individuals with hemophilia to live an active and full life. Moreover, with ongoing investment in the field of research, public education and awareness, and accessible healthcare systems, the future looks increasingly bright for individuals suffering from hemophilia. Continued research, innovation, and compassionate care are key to transforming this vision into a universal reality. As science progresses and awareness grows, the future holds immense promise, not just for controlling the disease but for curing it entirely. There is real hope that in the future, the challenges posed by hemophilia will not only be managed more effectively but may also be eliminated.\n",
