      "Section 1 - What is Psoriasis?\n",
      "#article/psoriasis\n",
      "Imagine your skin working overtime, producing new cells at an accelerated rate, faster than they can shed. The result? Patches of red, inflamed, and sometimes flaky skin that just would not go away. This is psoriasis, a chronic autoimmune condition that goes beyond the surface, affecting not only your skin but your overall health. While it is often mistaken as a simple skin issue, psoriasis is a complex condition that can impact everything from your joints to your mental well-being. \n",
      "Psoriasis comes in different forms, including the most common type, plaque psoriasis, where the skin becomes covered with raised, red patches. Other types, like guttate psoriasis (small, dot-like lesions), inverse psoriasis (affecting skin folds), and pustular psoriasis (characterized by white pustules), vary in appearance and severity. One of the most severe forms, erythrodermic psoriasis, can cause widespread redness, scaling, and pain. \n",
      "What makes psoriasis truly complex is that it is not just a cosmetic issue; it is a systemic condition. This means that it can affect the body as a whole. People with psoriasis often experience other health challenges, such as joint pain and inflammation (psoriatic arthritis), heart disease, or even mental health issues like depression and anxiety. While the exact cause is still unclear, researchers believe that both genetic factors and environmental triggers, such as stress, infections, or certain medications, play a role in triggering flare-ups. Let us dive into what psoriasis truly is and how it affects millions of people worldwide.\n",
      "1.1 Psoriasis by the Numbers: Global Prevalence\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the skin that occurs in approximately 2 to 3% of the world population. Prevalence varies significantly among regions, ranging from 11.4% in Northern Europe to 0.5% and 2% in Asian and African populations. In the United States, about 3% of the adult population is affected, which translates into about 7.5 million individuals. Prevalence also depends on genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and the availability of healthcare systems that influence diagnostic rates. Moreover, studies reveal that the disease is increasing in prevalence in most parts of the world, mainly because of increased diagnosis and awareness.\n",
      "1.2 Regional Insights: Where Is Psoriasis Most Prevalent?\n",
      "Psoriasis may affect all ages, races, and sexes. The condition is, however, very common between the ages of 15 and 35. There is also an equal incidence among both men and women. Despite this, the burden of psoriasis is differently distributed in racial and ethnic groups. For example, although 3.6% of white adults suffer from the disease in the U.S., it is 1.9% among Hispanic adults and 1.5% among Black adults. The condition often has a genetic component, and up to 40% of cases report a family history of psoriasis. Although the prevalence of psoriasis can occur among children, it is less common as it affects only 1% of pediatric populations. Therefore, these demographics require special approaches in the diagnosis, treatment, and management of psoriasis for different populations.\n",
      "1.3 Psoriasis Uncovered: Myths vs. Facts\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "Time to break the myths behind psoriasis and bring on the stigma of understanding. Here are some of the common myths and facts behind them.\n",
      "Myth 1: Psoriasis Is Contagious.\n",
      "Fact: Psoriasis is an autoimmune disease and cannot be transmitted by contact.\n",
      "Myth 2: Psoriasis Is a Skin Disease.\n",
      "Fact: Psoriasis is a systemic disease, which means it affects more than just the skin. In most cases, it leads to joint pain and predisposes to other diseases.\n",
      "Myth 3: Psoriasis Is Caused by Poor Hygiene.\n",
      "Fact: Psoriasis has nothing to do with hygiene; it is a complex condition involving genetics and immune dysfunction.\n",
      "Myth 4: Psoriasis Can Be Cured.\n",
      "Fact: While there is no cure, treatments can manage symptoms and significantly improve quality of life.\n",
      "Myth 5: People With Psoriasis Should Avoid Physical Activity.\n",
      "Fact: Exercise can help reduce stress and inflammation, making it a beneficial part of managing psoriasis.\n",
      "Myth 6: Psoriasis Only Affects Adults.\n",
      "Fact: Psoriasis can affect children as well, though it may present differently.\n",
      "1.4 Combating Stigma Through Education\n",
      "Raising awareness and understanding about psoriasis is very important in the fight against stigma. Shared personal stories, open conversations, and encouraging educational campaigns can bring the needed support to patients' lives. The more knowledge we have, the more empathetic we will be, and that will be the key to the empowerment of the patient in seeking the proper care.\n",

      "#article/no - article\n",
      "2.1 Layers of the skin \n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "1. Epidermis: This is the outer layer that provides a protective barrier against the environment.  This layer is made up of keratinocytes, melanocytes, and Langerhans cells. This layer produces keratin because it contains keratinocytes. The epidermis is further divided into different layers:\n",
      "Stratum Corneum: This is the outer layer of dead and flattened cells, called corneocytes. These layers function as a skin barrier in protecting the skin from external agents, including fungi, bacteria, and chemicals. The stratum corneum is the thickest on soles and palms and sheds one layer of corneocytes every day to maintain its thickness.\n",
      "Stratum Lucidum: This is present only in thick skin. It is a thin, transparent layer that separates the living and dead layers of the epidermis. The layer is located between the corneum and granulosum.\n",
      "Stratum Granulosum: This is a thin layer in the epidermis that contains keratin and lipid granules. The layer facilitates cell adhesion by creating a permeability barrier to water in the corneum.\n",
      "Stratum Spinosum: This is the outermost layer in the epidermis, providing strength and flexibility to the skin; desmosomes connect cells.\n",
      "Stratum Basale: This is the deepest innermost layer where new skin cells are generated.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Dermis: This is the middle layer of the skin that supports the epidermis, provides nutrition and also houses structures like blood vessels, sweat glands, nerves, and hair follicles. The dermis is composed of collagen and elastin fibers. This layer also houses key immune cells that are involved in psoriasis:\n",
      "Dendritic cells that trigger inflammation.\n",
      "T cells that become overactive.\n",
      "Produces inflammatory proteins called cytokines, especially IL (interleukin)-17, IL-23, and TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor-alpha).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Hypodermis: This is the subcutaneous layer that provides insulation, cushioning, and energy storage and is composed of fat and connective tissue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Skin Cell Turnover\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "In healthy skin, stratum basale produces keratinocytes which migrate upward to the top layers in 28 to 40 days and then gradually flatten and become corneocytes in the stratum corneum before turnover or shedding. However, in psoriasis, the turnover rate of these cells speeds up drastically, and they take only three to seven days which eventually leads to the buildup of immature keratinocytes that pile up on the skin surface and lead to scaling (accumulated dead skin cells), plaques (raised, red patches with silvery scales), and inflammation (caused by immune system activation).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 The Immune System’s Role in Skin Health\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "In healthy skin, your immune system acts as a well-regulated defense force, protecting against potential threats while keeping normal skin cell production and turnover in balance. However, in psoriasis, this immune response becomes disrupted and overactive:\n",
      "The cycle typically begins when something triggers the immune system, such as stress, an injury, or certain medications. These triggers cause immune cells to become inappropriately activated.\n",
      "Once activated, specialized immune cells, called T cells, begin releasing inflammatory proteins (cytokines), which are considered alarm signals that spread through the skin.\n",
      "These inflammatory signals then trigger keratinocytes to start reproducing much faster than normal. Instead of taking a month to mature and shed, the skin cells accelerate the process entirely in just a few days.\n",
      "Since the skin cells multiply so rapidly, they build up faster than they can be shed. This creates the characteristic thick, red, scaly patches known as plaques.\n",
      "Unfortunately, this creates a vicious cycle - the plaques themselves trigger more inflammation, which causes more rapid skin cell growth, leading to more plaques. The cycle continues unless interrupted by medical intervention or treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.4 Autoimmune Processes Underlying Psoriasis\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "Psoriasis involves both adaptive immunity (which identifies and remembers specific threats) and innate immunity (our body's first-line defense), with T-cells playing a significant role.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Immune Dysregulation\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "Initial Process - Antigen Recognition:\n",
      "Specialized immune cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs), particularly dendritic cells, mistakenly identify normal skin components as threats.\n",
      "These APCs then process and display these \"threats\" to naive T-cells, which have not yet encountered any specific threats.\n",
      "This interaction activates the T-cells, transforming them into specific types: Th (T-helper cells)1, Th17, and Th22 cells.\n",
      "Cytokines Cascade:\n",
      "Once activated, these T-cells trigger a complex cascade of inflammatory signals, and the cytokines involved are:\n",
      "TNF-α: It acts like an alarm bell that triggers inflammation and calls more immune cells to the skin.\n",
      "IL-23: It specifically supports and expands the population of Th17 cells.\n",
      "IL-17: These instruct keratinocytes to multiply rapidly and produce even more inflammatory signals.\n",
      "IL-22: These make the skin thicker by making keratinocytes multiply.\n",
      "IFN-γ: They amplify the overall immune response and keep the inflammation going.\n",
      "2. Genetic Predisposition\n",
      "#article/genetics-of-psoriasis\n",
      "Research has identified several key genetic regions linked to psoriasis development, with the most significant being the PSORS1 locus found on chromosome 6. This genetic component helps explain why psoriasis tends to run in families. The main genetic components include: \n",
      "HLA-Cw6: It is located within the PSORS1 region and affects how the immune system recognizes and responds to potential threats. Individuals with this variant are more likely to develop psoriasis at a younger age.\n",
      "IL23R (Interleukin-23 Receptor): It influences how cells respond to inflammatory signals; therefore, any variations in this gene can make immune cells more reactive. This also helps explain why drugs targeting IL-23 can be effective treatments\n",
      "TNFAIP3: It acts as a natural brake on inflammation, and variants can reduce this braking effect when impaired, inflammation becomes harder to control.\n",
      "3. Environmental Triggers\n",
      "#article/psoriasis\n",
      "\n",
      "Infections: Streptococcus throat (pharyngitis) is a particularly common trigger. It often leads to a specific type of psoriasis called guttate psoriasis, which appears as small, drop-shaped lesions across the body.\n",
      "Certain Medications: These include beta-blockers (used for heart conditions), lithium (used for bipolar disorder), and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that are common pain relievers). These medications can either trigger new cases or make existing psoriasis worse.\n",
      "Physical Injury to the Skin (Koebner Phenomenon): Even minor skin trauma can trigger new psoriasis patches, which can be caused by cuts, scrapes, sunburns, or even tight clothing. Also, new lesions can appear exactly where the skin was injured, usually within two to six weeks after the injury.\n",
      "Stress Response: Psychological stress can trigger new flare-ups or worsen existing ones. Stress hormones in the body increase the production of inflammatory proteins (cytokines) and create a challenging cycle; stress worsens psoriasis, which in turn increases stress.\n",
      "4. Contribution of Innate Immune System\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "\n",
      "The innate immune system of the body's rapid response team also plays a significant role along with T-cells in the development of psoriasis:\n",
      "Neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, move into the outer layer of skin (epidermis) and luster together to form what we call Munro's microabscesses. These microscopic collections of neutrophils are a hallmark sign of psoriasis and can be found within the thick, scaly plaques.\n",
      "Macrophages, immune cells that usually clean up cellular debris, become overactive in psoriatic lesions and release their own set of inflammatory signals, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), which triggers inflammation, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), which amplifies the inflammatory response. These signals work alongside T-cell-produced cytokines to maintain the inflammatory state\n",
      "These innate immune cells, together, add another layer to the inflammatory cascade, making the immune response in psoriasis even more complex and self-perpetuating.\n",

Researchers found that psoriasis patients have a reduced diversity of gut bacteria and an increase in specific pro-inflammatory microbial species, which may contribute to systemic inflammation. Key bacterial changes include a higher presence of Escherichia coli and a reduction in beneficial bacteria like Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, which has anti-inflammatory properties. These findings suggest that gut microbiome imbalances might influence psoriasis severity and progression. The study highlights the potential for microbiome-targeted therapies, such as probiotics, prebiotics, and dietary interventions, to help manage psoriasis symptoms.

      "#article/vulvar-psoriasis\n",
      "The following are the risk factors associated with psoriasis:\n",
      "Mechanical Stress: The Koebner phenomenon, where skin lesions appear on previously unaffected areas following trauma, is a hallmark of psoriasis. Injuries such as cuts, radiotherapy, or ultraviolet (UV) exposure may induce lesions. While the phenomenon’s mechanisms remain unclear, increased blood flow in the dermis and elevated nerve growth factor (NGF) expression are implicated. Resident memory T cells (TRM), retained in resolved lesions, play a critical role in recurring and trauma-induced psoriasis. Skin injuries also prompt type 1 interferon production, which initiates psoriatic inflammation.\n",
      "Air Pollution and Sun Exposure: Air pollutants like cadmium and ultraviolet radiation contribute to psoriasis pathogenesis. Cadmium exposure disrupts immunity, worsening psoriasis, while UV radiation has dual effects: it can exacerbate psoriasis in some cases, yet UVB phototherapy is a cornerstone of treatment.\n",
      "Drugs: Certain medications, including β-blockers, lithium, and antimalarials, can trigger or exacerbate psoriasis. These effects, often mediated through keratinocyte hyperproliferation or cytokine imbalances, may persist after discontinuation. Biologic therapies targeting TNF-α, IL-23, or IL-17 can also paradoxically induce psoriasis.\n",
      "Vaccination: While vaccinations are essential for infection prevention in psoriasis patients, they can sometimes exacerbate the condition. Influenza and BCG vaccines, among others, may trigger psoriasis through Th1 and Th17 immune responses.\n",
      "Infection: Infections, particularly streptococcal infections, are well-established triggers for guttate psoriasis. Dysbiosis of the skin and mucosal microbiomes, including colonization by Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, may also exacerbate psoriasis.\n",
      "Lifestyle Factors: Smoking and alcohol consumption are associated with increased psoriasis risk and severity. Smoking correlates with pustular lesions and psoriasis onset, with a dose-response relationship. While evidence linking alcohol consumption to psoriasis is less conclusive, heavy drinking worsens disease severity and reduces treatment efficacy. Dietary factors may influence psoriasis by affecting gut microbiota and cytokine balance. New research shows that the severity of psoriasis is reduced with a plant-rich diet, low in saturated fat, salt, and sugar, and rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, and lean meats. Interventions such as supplementation with polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin D, and antioxidants have shown mixed results in managing psoriasis, highlighting the complexity of dietary influences.\n",
      "NF-kB c-Rel Protein: A new study conducted by the Western Reserve University School of Medicine has shown that the protein NF-kB c-Rel, which is activated by immune system signals, worsens psoriasis symptoms. The role of c-Rel in skin inflammation has been found, and it may be used to develop innovative psoriasis treatments.\n",
      "Emerging Contaminants (ECs): Emerging contaminants (ECs) are often disregarded risk factors for psoriasis, according to recent research. These pollutants, which include heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), might interfere with immunological responses by activating immune cells like macrophages and raising pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-α and IL-17. The study provides information for improved therapeutic management of psoriasis by highlighting the necessity of limiting exposure to ECs and investigating their effects on the immune system.\n",

      "Age-Related Trends\n",
      "Comorbidities tend to increase with age. A recent study found that patients over 65 years old exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, elevated waist-to-hip ratio, diabetes mellitus, and hyperglycemia. Psoriasis patients face:\n",
      "4-fold increased risk of type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "3-fold increased risk of myocardial infarction.\n",
      "Shortened life expectancy by approximately four years compared to healthy controls.\n",

      "\n",
      "Pathogenesis and Shared Mechanisms\n",
      "While genetic susceptibility explains part of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) heritability, newer models emphasize a combination of:\n",

      "Inflammatory pathways and genetic predispositions play a pivotal role. Key findings include:\n",
      "HLA-Cw6 is associated with psoriasis and PsA.\n",
      "Overlap between psoriasis susceptibility genes (e.g., PSORS2, PSORS3, PSORS4) and loci linked to metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, familial hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular (CV) disease.\n",

      "\n",
      "Metabolic Syndrome\n",
      "Obesity and metabolic syndrome, which includes insulin resistance and hypertension, are closely associated with psoriasis. It has been demonstrated that lifestyle changes including controlling weight can lessen the severity of psoriasis and its related risks. Psoriasis is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, which includes:\n",
      "Central obesity.\n",
      "Hypertriglyceridemia.\n",
      "Low high-density lipoprotein (HDL).\n",
      "Hypertension.\n",
      "Insulin resistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women with psoriasis face a 63% higher risk of developing diabetes than non-prosoriatic women. Obesity, particularly visceral, exacerbates inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Elevated levels of inflammatory mediators like TNF-α and leptin, coupled with reduced anti-inflammatory adiponectin, drive insulin resistance and CV risks. The \"psoriatic march\" hypothesis posits that systemic inflammation leads to insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction, atherosclerosis, and eventually myocardial infarction or stroke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardiovascular Disease and Psoriasis\n",
      "Data support the association of psoriasis with CV risk, especially in severe cases where patients are on long-term systemic drugs or have been hospitalized. The higher prevalence of CV risk factors predisposes patients to increased risks of atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. Psoriasis confers an independent risk for myocardial infarction, with the relative risk being most significant in young patients with severe psoriasis.\n",

      "Chronic Kidney Disease and Psoriasis:\n",
      "In a recent study published in Clinical, Cosmetic, and Investigational Dermatology, researchers aimed to identify immune-related biomarkers linking psoriasis and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Utilizing machine learning algorithms on gene expression datasets, they discovered a three-gene signature comprising SERPINB4, S100A7A, and SPRR2C. These genes were significantly upregulated in both psoriasis and CKD samples. Further analysis revealed that their expression correlated with increased infiltration of immune cells, such as macrophages and T cells, in affected tissues. These findings suggest a shared immunological pathway between psoriasis and CKD, highlighting potential targets for therapeutic intervention.\n",

      "\n",
      "Liver and Gastrointestinal Tract\n",
      "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is more prevalent in psoriasis patients. NAFLD includes a spectrum ranging from simple fatty liver to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which can lead to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinoma. NAFLD is considered the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome. Studies show a higher prevalence of NAFLD in psoriasis patients (47% vs. 28% in controls). NAFLD is associated with higher C-reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels, lower adiponectin levels, and a higher risk of methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity.\n",
      "New research shows that psoriasis patients can suffer from unnoticed inflammation in the small intestine and a higher chance of getting a \"leaky gut.\" These changes in the gut microbiome might explain why psoriasis patients have higher rates of digestive problems and are more likely to develop Crohn’s disease.\n",

      "\n",
      "Psychological and behavioral therapy should complement medical treatments to address these psychosocial challenges effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Management and Recommendations\n",
      "Psoriasis treatment must account for comorbidities to avoid drug interactions and contraindications. Biologics, TNF-α inhibitors, and statins can mitigate inflammation and reduce CV risks. Dermatologists should collaborate with other specialists to ensure a multidisciplinary approach, screening for CV risk factors, metabolic syndrome, and other comorbidities.  Psoriasis is associated with systemic inflammation, which raises the risk of cardiovascular illnesses, depression, and metabolic syndrome, according to the 2025 AAD Annual Meeting. Biologics that target the IL-17 and IL-23 pathways have been demonstrated to relieve skin symptoms and lower depression, while aggressive treatments such as IL-23 inhibitors have been shown to lower long-term cardiovascular risks. Weight reduction and other lifestyle changes were emphasized as being essential for reducing metabolic syndrome. In order to improve patient outcomes, our findings highlight the significance of comprehensive care that addresses both systemic and cutaneous concerns. Psoriasis has a major effect on mental health and frequently causes anxiety and sadness. Depression scores have been seen to decrease with biologic therapy that target the IL-17 and IL-23 pathways, indicating direct mental benefits beyond skin clearance. Patients with psoriasis who have chronic inflammation are more susceptible to heart attacks and strokes because it speeds up atherosclerosis. Imaging studies have demonstrated that individuals receiving IL-23 inhibitors have stabilized plaque in their arteries, highlighting the significance of vigorous treatment and early cardiovascular monitoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recommendations for Screening\n",
      "The American Heart Association recommends early screening for CV risk factors as early as age 20. By age 40, regular assessments for blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, and glucose levels are advised. Lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and regular exercise, are critical.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Plaque Psoriasis\n",
      "#article/plaque-psoriasis\n",
      "Plaques typically remain static or slowly enlarge, and spontaneous resolution is rare. When this happens, you might notice thick, raised patches on your skin called plaques. Some of these plaques may have a dry, silvery-white layer of scale on them. The plaques can vary in size, and smaller ones can merge to form larger ones. They usually appear on areas like the scalp, elbows, knees, or lower back, but they can appear anywhere on the skin. The extensor surfaces of the knees, elbows, scalp, and trunk are where this most frequently occurs. Plaques often itch, but scratching can make them worse and thicker. To help with the itching, doctors recommend treating the psoriasis. A recent study published in the Journal of Inflammation Research has identified a protein called FLI1 as a significant contributor to the development of plaque psoriasis, a common chronic skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches. The research indicates that elevated levels of FLI1 in skin cells can initiate and worsen psoriasis symptoms. Conversely, reducing FLI1 levels appears to alleviate these symptoms. This discovery suggests that targeting FLI1 could be a promising strategy for developing new treatments for plaque psoriasis.\n",

      "#article/inverse-psoriasis\n",
      "Inverse psoriasis occurs in areas where skin rubs against skin, like the armpits, genitals, and the crease of the buttocks. You may notice smooth, red patches that look raw, with little or no silvery-white scale. It is found mostly in the skin folds and presents as thin lesions with minimal scaling. The affected skin may also be sore or painful. This type of psoriasis is also known as intertriginous psoriasis. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Guttate Psoriasis\n",
      "#article/symptoms-and-complications-of-psoriasis\n",
      "Guttate psoriasis appears as small, salmon-pink bumps, usually around 1 to 10 mm in size, mainly on the trunk. These bumps may be scaly and often appear suddenly, about 2 to 3 weeks after an upper respiratory infection, like strep throat. The bumps can spread across the torso, legs, arms, and sometimes the face, scalp, and ears. They are typically small, scaly, and pink in color. While they are temporary and usually go away on their own in a few weeks or months, they may not come back. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, in some cases, guttate psoriasis may reappear later as plaque psoriasis. It is most common in children and young adults after an infection, and once the infection clears, the psoriasis may also disappear. However, some people may have guttate psoriasis for life, or it may later develop into plaque psoriasis. It is hard to predict how the condition will evolve after the initial flare-up.

The doctor will also ask about when the skin lesions first appeared, frequency, and whether they are itchy or painful. They may also check for joint pain or swelling. If you have been treated for psoriasis before, let them know what treatments you have tried so they can recommend the best options for you. It is also important to tell your doctor about any other health conditions or medications you’re taking. Certain conditions, like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of psoriasis.\n",

Researchers analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare traditional metrics like Body Mass Index (BMI) and Waist Circumference (WC) with newer indices such as A Body Shape Index (ABSI) and Body Roundness Index (BRI). The findings revealed that a higher BRI is positively associated with an increased risk of psoriasis and outperforms both BMI and ABSI in identifying individuals with the condition. This suggests that BRI may serve as a more effective tool for assessing psoriasis risk related to body composition.

      "As per the recent report published following a survey study in psoriasis patients who had gone through topical therapies, it was found that almost 47 percent of them had skin thinning and atrophy. Skin thinning is a known side effect of topical therapies, but the disappointing fact is that out of this 47 percent, only 24.6 percent reported their side effects to their doctors seeking help. While around 30.6 percent blindly stopped the therapy without even letting their doctor know about their concerns. Also, 27.3 patients who participated in the survey continued their topical treatment beyond the time frame that was recommended for them by their doctor. This study itself highlights that most patients were not previously informed of the side effects and how important it is to follow the doctor’s recommendations to ensure that the treatment is safe and effective for them. Addressing these areas can definitely improve patient compliance and treatment adherence, which will enhance the therapeutic outcome. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, one clinical study also shows mortality due to Cushing’s syndrome caused by excessive use of topical corticosteroids. Therefore, it is recommended to use only about 40 to 50 grams of potent and not more than 100 grams of moderately potent corticosteroids per week to prevent system absorption.\n",

      "#article/calcipotriene\n",
      "For treating plague psoriasis (mild to moderate), vitamin D analogs are considered to be the standard treatment option because of their potential benefits. Vitamin D analogs work by binding to the receptors of vitamin D in the skin and regulating the genes that control keratinization, control inflammation, and epidermal proliferation. They slow cell overproduction, minimize skin cell proliferation, modulate the responses of the immune system, and regulate skin cell growth and differentiation. They are available as creams, foams, solutions, and ointments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following medications contain vitamin D analogs:\n",
      "Calcitriol - This vitamin D analog is an active form of vitamin D and is effective for sensitive skin areas because it is less irritant. It is available in ointment form and is recommended to be used in children below the age of two years.\n",
      "Calcipotriol (Calcipotriene) - This is the most commonly used vitamin D analog prescribed for treating chronic plaque psoriasis. It is a synthetic vitamin D3 derivative and is available in ointment and cream form.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vitamin D and Corticosteroid - Combination Therapy:\n",
      "Studies show that topical vitamin D can be an effective standalone treatment for mild to moderate psoriasis. However, research indicates that when combined with corticosteroids, patients may experience enhanced therapeutic outcomes. This combination therapy not only increases medication effectiveness but also helps mitigate potential skin inflammation and reduces the likelihood of side effects typically associated with corticosteroid-only treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dual-drug approach offers additional benefits, particularly in terms of treatment duration. Patients can safely use the combination therapy for up to four weeks, followed by a mandatory four-week break. This intermittent treatment strategy allows the skin sufficient time to heal and recover between medication cycles. Moreover, this combination is versatile, as it can be applied to all affected areas, including the body and scalp, providing comprehensive psoriasis management.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations of Vitamin D Analogs:\n",
      "Hypercalcemia - Elevated calcium levels in the blood or hypercalcemia can be caused by vitamin D analogs. \n",
      "Hyperphosphatemia - Increased phosphate absorption can also occur due to vitamin D analogs and results in hyperphosphatemia.\n",
      "Calciphylaxis - Vitamin D analogs cause calcium buildup in the blood vessels and lead to calciphylaxis.\n",
      "Drug Interactions - The safety and efficacy of vitamin D analogs can be affected if they interact with other medications, such as antiepileptic drugs, phosphate binders, or glucocorticoids.\n",
      "Narrow Therapeutic Window - Vitamin D analogs also have a narrow therapeutic window and can cause severe toxicity. Therefore, careful monitoring of phosphate, calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels is needed.\n",

      "\n",
      "Research has consistently validated the therapeutic potential of Tazarotene gel at concentrations of 0.05% and 0.1% and these clinical investigations reveal that the medications offer the ability to provide sustained management of psoriasis symptoms over extended periods. Additionally, a notable advantage of Tazarotene gel includes its versatility in treatment, proving particularly effective for scalp psoriasis and facial psoriasis, a treatment area where other topical medications like Calcipotriene are limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retinoids exert their therapeutic effect by interacting with two critical cellular receptors: retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and retinoid X receptors (RXRs). By binding to these receptors within skin cells, they primarily alter gene expression and cellular behavior. This molecular mechanism enables retinoids to treat psoriasis completely by achieving two primary objectives, such as interrupting the uncontrolled proliferation of keratinocytes and parallelly guiding these cells toward a more normalized differentiation process. Additionally, retinoids demonstrate immunomodulatory properties, actively suppressing inflammatory signaling by downregulating key pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-17 (IL-17), which play a crucial role in the psoriatic inflammatory cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limitations of Retinoids (Topical):\n",
      "Hypersensitivity - Topical retinoids have an inherent tendency to dry out skin making them potentially problematic in cases of eczema because they can potentially be exacerbating existing skin irritation and inflammation. \n",
      "Photosensitivity - Increased sensitivity to sunlight (photosensitivity) represents another significant side effect. Therefore, patients must use robust sun protection when using retinoids. \n",
      "Teratogenicity - The systemic absorption of topical retinoids remains relatively less, however the potential teratogenic risks are substantial enough to impose strict contraceptive measures for women of reproductive age. \n",
      "Pediatric use - The use of retinoids in children is generally circumspect, with guidelines and recommendations varying across different healthcare jurisdictions and specific product formulations. Therefore, healthcare providers must carefully evaluate pediatric patient’s conditions, weighing potential benefits against possible risks when prescribing retinoid treatment.\n",

      "This is the most commonly used and effective treatment for psoriasis. UVB is also present in natural sunlight. This ultraviolet light can penetrate the skin and help slow down the progression of affected skin cells, thus clearing the skin significantly and prolonging the remission. The affected skin is exposed to the artificial UVB of a specific wavelength of 311 to 313 nanometers at regular intervals, typically given twice or thrice a week. In this method, a person is made to stand in a light box, and the light source is passed over their skin. This phototherapy is highly effective with minimal side effects as compared to other types of UV treatments. Further, these UVBs are of two types -\n",

However, long-term clinical data is still lacking to prove its efficacy for prolonged improvements in psoriasis while using these laser therapies.\n",
      "Localized Units - These are small units of UVB indicated for treating psoriasis lesions in a small localized area like feet and hands, where full-body therapy is not required, and also where topical medication cannot be used.\n",
      "Home-Based Treatment - This is a convenient and cost-effective option for phototherapy but requires regular treatment schedules for better outcomes. The initial treatment therapy is given to the person in the medical facility, and then advised and instructed for light units at home. Using phototherapy at home is critical, and therefore, an individual must follow the doctor’s instructions carefully and take regular follow-ups.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. PUVA Therapy: UVA or ultraviolet A is used along with Psoralen in this method and hence, termed as PUVA therapy. UVA is ineffective against psoriasis and, thus, requires a light-sensitizing agent to slow down the progression of psoriasis symptoms. PUVA therapy is potentially effective against plaque psoriasis, psoriasis of palm and soles, and guttate psoriasis. The therapy is very intensive and involves oral and topical medication along with UVA light exposure. \n",
      "\n",
      "PUVA is mainly administered in three forms:\n",
      "Topical Cream - This is applied topically over the affected skin area, and after some time, UVA light treatment is given.\n",
      "Oral Pills (Psoralen) - An individual can take the oral tablets, and then after waiting for 45 to 60 minutes, they can take UVA light treatment.\n",
      "Bath PUVA: The psoralen medicine is mixed in bathwater, and the full body is soaked in it to make it sensitive to UV light; then, after some time, UV treatment is administered to the person.\n",

This compound binds to the A3 adenosine receptor and, when exposed to blue light, shifts to an active form that reduces inflammation by decreasing pro-inflammatory cytokine production. In animal models, targeted blue light exposure activated MRS7787, leading to significant improvements in psoriasis symptoms. This approach offers a potential alternative to traditional therapies, aiming to minimize side effects by combining precise drug activation with light exposure.\n",

      "#article/tazarotene #article/acitretin-capsules\n",
      "Unlike, topical medications or UV therapies, oral medications work by affecting the entire system of the body rather than just a specific targeted area or body part. The treatment is mainly indicated for moderate to severe cases of psoriasis, especially when other treatments, such as topical and UV therapy, are insufficient to manage the condition effectively or an individual does not respond well or is unable to tolerate other treatment options. The most common systemic medications used to treat psoriasis are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Methotrexate - It was initially approved for treating cancer, but in 1970, the FDA approved the medication for psoriasis. Methotrexate works by binding to and inhibiting the enzyme that causes rapid skin cell growth, thus slowing its growth rate. It is an immune-modulating drug that helps suppress the immune system by reducing skin inflammation and cell turnover. \n",
      "The medication can treat psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis. Methotrexate is prescribed as a weekly dosage of oral or injectable medication, and a person requires regular monitoring of liver function and blood count to avoid potential side effects, such as bone marrow suppression and liver toxicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyclosporine - These medications have a rapid onset of action and therefore, these are fast-acting immunosuppressants for treating severe cases of psoriasis. The medication was initially used to prevent organ transplant rejection and later in 1970, FDA approved the medication for psoriasis. \n",
      "Cyclosporins are mainly prescribed as a short-term treatment because of the potential side effects associated with them, such as hypertension risk, kidney damage, and nephrotoxicity. Therefore, cyclosporins are not recommended for long-term treatment of psoriasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retinoids (Acitretin) -  Acitretin is an oral retinoid, a synthetic form of vitamin A derivative approved by the FDA specifically for the treatment of psoriasis. The medication is mainly used to treat pustular psoriasis as it inhibits skin cell growth by controlling cell multiplication. Acitretin is available in capsule form to be taken along with food once a day. The medication causes severe dryness and is also contraindicated in pregnant women and women of childbearing age due to its potential for teratogenicity.\n",

      "Medications Under Development: \n",
      "There are several drugs that are in the process of clinical trials proving their efficacy in tackling psoriasis. \n",
      "\n",
      "One such drug is Icotrokinra, which is being developed by the Johnson and Johnson pharmaceutical company and is formulated for oral intake with a frequecny of once a day. As per the recent reports, Icotrokinra has achieved the primary goal in its phase 3 clinical trial stage. In around 64.7 percent of the study subjects, Icotrokina therapy for a period of 16 weeks produced notable skin clearance, and in 49.6 percent, it brought down the severity of psoriatic lesions significantly. These findings are really appreciable however, further studies and trials need to be carried out to ascertain these findings. In early 2025, Icotrokinra will enter into its late-stage clinical trial, which will facilitate its reach to the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "Zasocitinib (TAK-279) is another drug for psoriasis that is currently under development. It is basically an oral tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) inhibitor. It is currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials. This investigational drug has produced appreciable results in its phase 2b trial in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritic subjects. Around 67 percent of subjects with psoriasis attained PASI 75 with 12 weeks of therapy, while 33 percent attained PASI 100, which means complete skin clearance. These results indicate that it's a promising investigational drug. However, we have to wait until it gets a green flag from the drug regulatory body. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor drug called Sotyktu (Deucravacitinib) is under development by Bristol Myers Squibb for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. It is currently going through its phase 3 clinical trial as part of the POETYK PsA-2 study. As per the 16th-week results from the phase 3 clinical trial, around 54.2 percent of the subjects attained more than 20 percent improvement in their symptoms. In addition, most patients attained a PASI score of 75, which highlights the efficacy of the drug in managing psoriatic arthritis. Adverse effects were reported in around 62.8 percent of the cases, but none of them were found to be severe or dangerous, and the subjects tolerated them well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another psoriasis drug that is being studied is SFA-002, which is basically a small-molecule biosynthetic medicine formulation that has been designed for oral intake. SFA Therapeutics is the pharmaceutical company that is carrying out the study for this drug molecule. The preclinical study results of SFA-002 were presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting 2025, and the results were quite promising. The severity of psoriasis symptoms and the skin thickening that often accompanies psoriasis both reduced significantly in animal models treated with SFA-002. The reduction in severity and skin thickness achieved with SFA-002 were found to be better than the same achieved with other psoriasis drugs like Apremilast and Etanercept. Apart from animal models, it was also studied on human psoriasis-like skin models, and it was found that SFA-002 can lower the key inflammatory markers, and the results were somewhat equivalent to that of Apremilast and Betamethasone. \n",
      "\n",
      "ESK-001 is an investigational medicine whose trial is being conducted by Alumis Inc for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. It is basically an oral tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor. The drug completed its phase 2 recently, and its outcomes are pretty impressive and promising. Around 61.3 percent of the study subjects achieved a PASI score of 90 while around 38.8 percent of subjects achieved a PASI score of 100 after 52 weeks of treatment with the drug. On top of that most subjects tolerated the drug well and no significant safety issues were reported during the phase 2 trial. Alumis Inc. has currently begun the phase 3 clinical trial of the drug ESK-001 under the ONWARD program. We can expect its results by early 2026. \n",

      "Biologics medications, a living cell that is genetically modified to produce certain specific proteins, are also used for treating moderate to severe psoriasis. These medications mainly target some specific parts of a person’s immune system that cause overgrowth of the skin cells. Biologics is administered in the form of a shot or infusion to bypass the stomach where gastric acids can cause protein breakdown. These medications are highly effective against psoriasis and have minimal side effects. \n",
      "\n",
      "Following are the biologics medications used for treating psoriasis:\n",
      "TNF-α Inhibitors - These are broad-acting inhibitors that target the pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-alpha. These are effective for symptoms of both joint and skin. Some examples include Infliximab, Etanercept, and Adalimumab.\n",
      "IL-17 Inhibitors - These inhibitors target IL-17, which activates lymphocytes that produce inflammatory genes. Examples are Ixekizumab and Secukinumab.\n",
      "IL-23 Inhibitors - These inhibitors target IL-23, which involves the differentiation of naive Th cells into Th17. Examples: Risankizumab and Guselkumab.\n",
      "IL-12/23 Inhibitors - These inhibitors target IL-12 and IL-23, which are involved in intestinal inflammation and homeostasis. These biologics mainly offer long-lasting clearance with ver few doses. An example is ustekinumab.\n",
      "\n",
      "The choice of biologics medication for the patient mainly depends on their demographics, malignancy risk, infection, comorbidities, and treatment resistance. \n",
      "\n",
      "In a recent study, the researchers examined the mechanisms of psoriasis and advancements in pharmacological treatments, focusing on genetic, immune, and environmental factors that contributed to the disease. It highlighted the role of T cells, cytokines (IL-17, IL-23), and skin barrier dysfunction in driving inflammation and abnormal skin growth. Researchers also reviewed biologics, small molecule inhibitors, and emerging therapies, emphasizing the shift toward precision medicine for personalized treatment. Findings showed that biologic drugs had significantly improved psoriasis management and ongoing research aimed to develop more targeted, long-lasting therapies with fewer side effects. The review concluded that further studies were still needed to enhance treatment effectiveness and patient outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a case study published in Psoriasis: Targets and Therapy, researchers reported the successful treatment of linear psoriasis using the IL-17A antagonist Ixekizumab. The patient, a young adult with a history of treatment-resistant linear psoriasis, showed significant improvement after receiving biologic therapy targeting IL-17A. Traditional treatments, including topical corticosteroids and phototherapy, had provided only limited relief. However, after initiating Ixekizumab, the patient experienced rapid symptom resolution, with marked reductions in erythema, scaling, and lesion thickness. This case highlighted IL-17A inhibition as a promising approach for managing linear psoriasis, particularly in cases unresponsive to conventional therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biologics and Skin Cancers: As per a meta-analysis and systematic review report, the risk for melanoma and other skin cancers was found to be higher in those psoriasis and arthritic psoriasis patients who were treated with biologics when compared with the general population who have never had biologics. This conclusion was derived through the meta-analysis of 19 studies, totaling 13,739 patients. This indicates the need for more in-depth study on long-term adverse outcomes of biologics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Novel Treatment Approach: A novel treatment approach for psoriasis has been revealed in a recent study conducted by scientists at the Medical University of Vienna. These scientists have figured out that the functional attributes of regulatory T cells, which are otherwise regarded as Treg cells, can be disrupted by the enzyme SSAT. These Treg cells are critical for immune response modulation. \n",
      "So whenever the SSAT enzyme level increases, it causes impairment of more of the Treg cells causing an upsurge in the production of pro-inflammatory substances. As more pro-inflammatory substances get released, they favor inflammation to intense, causing psoriasis to flare up. Based on this principle, scientists at the  Medical University of Vienna conducted some preclinical studies to evaluate how it could be beneficial for psoriasis treatment. As part of the preclinical study, they conducted an in vivo study on animal models (they chose mice for testing) by inhibiting the SSAT enzyme. It was found that SSAT enzyme inhibition can restore the normal functions of Treg cells, which in turn settle down the inflammation and reduces psoriasis flare-ups. This discovery unraveled the scope of an improvised and more effective personalized psoriasis treatment approach by targeting the SSAT enzyme with the added advantage of minimal side effects than the existing stardard treatment choices. \n",

Scientific evidence suggests that diet can influence inflammatory and immunological responses, and certain dietary patterns can lower or worsen psoriasis symptoms. However, there are no recommended dietary guidelines for psoriasis patients. \n",

      "To manage psoriasis effectively, it is vital to treat the underlying systemic inflammation; hence, consuming foods that reduce inflammation or an anti-inflammatory diet can be beneficial to these patients. It is mainly an overall concept of consuming fresh and whole foods and balancing the right amount of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and other nutrients. Anti-inflammatory foods are rich in fiber, antioxidants, polyphenols, and other bioactive compounds that aid in reducing chronic inflammation. A high-fiber diet, vegan diet, Paleo diet, gluten-free diet, and Mediterranean diet are some of the examples of anti-inflammatory diets. Nevertheless, each individual reacts to food differently, so it is always recommended to consult a healthcare professional before incorporating any specific diet plan. \n",

Analyzing data from 257 adults with psoriasis, researchers discovered that low adherence to diets like the DASH diet and the Healthy Plant-based Diet Index correlated with increased psoriasis severity. Higher consumption of red and processed meats was also associated with more severe symptoms, even after accounting for body mass index. These findings suggest that dietary interventions could complement standard psoriasis treatments, potentially improving patient outcomes.\n",

Higher consumption of legumes, extra virgin olive oil, and fish was known to be associated with a low psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), whereas high dairy product consumption corresponded to an increased severity of psoriasis. Studies showed that the severity of psoriasis was lower in subjects with increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gluten-Free Diet (GFD): This diet pattern eliminates the consumption of gluten, a type of protein commonly found in wheat, rye, and barley. Psoriasis patients are at a high risk of developing celiac disease, a condition triggered by gluten consumption due to the common genetic and inflammatory pathways, and gluten-specific antibodies are higher in people living with psoriasis. Different systematic reviews have shown that a gluten-free diet can help lower the severity of psoriasis symptoms. A study conducted on 39 psoriasis patients with elevated gluten-specific antibodies who followed a GFD demonstrated a remarkable decrease in the mean PASI score compared to the control group. Patients with moderate or severe psoriasis also showed a reduction in PASI than those with mild psoriasis. A further study also reported that patients living with psoriasis and high levels of gluten-specific antibodies showed about 36 percent improvement in PASI score after following a gluten-free diet for one year. A few small, uncontrolled case studies have also revealed complete clearance of psoriatic skin symptoms after following GFD for one month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low-Calorie Diets (LCDs): These dietary interventions concern restricted energy intake and weight loss. All studies were conducted in psoriatic patients who were overweight and had a BMI (body mass index) of more than 25 kg/m2, and the diets prescribed varied from 500 kcal/day to 1600 kcal/day. About six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were performed to evaluate the effects of LCDs on 499 participants. The review demonstrated a significant improvement of more than 75 percent from the baseline psoriasis area and severity index in people living with psoriasis compared to usual care. Various randomized controlled trials have been conducted in psoriasis patients with obesity, and there was a remarkable reduction in severity compared to control groups. Research reveals that vegan, plant-based, or vegetarian diets also have the potential to alleviate psoriasis symptoms, but these diets focus mainly on decreased intake of saturated fats and increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants. However, there is no adequate data that determine the effectiveness of these diets in the management of psoriasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Very Low-Calorie Ketogenic Diet (VLCKD): An important requirement of a ketogenic diet is the restriction of carbohydrate intake. These diets have low energy content and are recommended only in psoriasis patients with obesity. Weight loss after a VLCKD for up to four weeks, followed by a balanced low-calorie diet for about six weeks, demonstrated significant improvement in psoriasis patients, including their itch severity. Studies conducted on psoriasis relapse cases after treatment also showed a reduction in the severity by following a VLCKD diet for about four weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intermittent Fasting: Two studies have explored this type of diet to understand its effects on psoriasis. It was conducted on 121 people with stable chronic plaque psoriasis, which involved consuming only two main meals a day, one before sunrise and one after sunset, and refraining from any type of drinking, eating, and smoking during the day. After one month, no significant weight loss was observed, but the mean PASI levels were significantly reduced in these individuals. A pilot study presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venerology revealed that scaling and thickness in patients with mild psoriasis were markedly reduced after consuming a 5:2 diet, that is, consuming generally for five days and restricting calories on two non-consecutive days.\n",

      "Vitamin D: Lower levels of serum vitamin D have been observed in psoriasis patients compared to normal individuals. Topical vitamin D supplementation is extensively used to treat plaque psoriasis. A randomized controlled trial conducted to assess the effect of oral vitamin D2 supplementation in psoriasis patients showed increased serum vitamin D levels and improvement in PASI scores compared to the placebo group. A meta-analysis study has reported that oral vitamin D supplementation has a favorable effect on psoriatic patients. However, further trials are necessary to confirm the conclusions. High doses of oral vitamin D3 given to psoriasis patients with low vitamin D status for six months demonstrated a significant reduction in psoriasis severity. Oral vitamin D supplements at a dose of 50000 IU (International Units) per week for three months, along with usual psoriasis treatment, showed a statistically significant improvement in PASI scores compared to the control group.\n",

      "Selenium: Various small studies have evaluated the effectiveness of selenium supplementation on the severity of psoriasis. Selenium combined with vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 showed a beneficial effect on PASI scores compared to the control group.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA): A recent 2019 meta-analysis study demonstrated that omega-3 PUFA supplementation remarkably reduced PASI scores. A systematic review also found that traditional psoriasis treatments, along with omega-3 PUFA supplementation showed a decrease in PASI score compared to the control group. Various clinical trials have also reported that itching, erythema, and other skin symptoms and comorbidities reduced significantly at higher doses of omega-3 supplements in psoriasis patients. HRO supplementation of 2600 mg Eicosapentaenoic (EPA)/Docosahexaenoic per day showed a good improvement in the mean PASI score compared to a placebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probiotics: Recent studies have shown that gut microbiome plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of various dermatological conditions, including psoriasis. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is also known to be associated with psoriasis, and the gut microbiome is altered in psoriatic patients compared to normal individuals. Lower gut microbial diversity is observed in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis than in those with mild disease. Therefore, probiotic supplementation is a recent topic of focus in the management of psoriasis. A systematic review has shown a reduction in PASI scores and psoriasis symptoms after 12 weeks of probiotic supplementation. A recent randomized controlled trial reported that consuming a probiotic drink with Lactobacillus strains for eight weeks significantly reduced psoriatic symptoms and PASI scores compared to a placebo group.\n",

It can be stigmatizing for many patients as psoriasis patches may be visible on the scalp, knees, elbows, and other open areas, leading to anxiety, stress, or depression about their looks and appearance. It can also lead to suicidal tendencies or substance misuse in some patients. However, though the exact relationship between stress and psoriasis symptoms is unknown, excessive stress can lead to psoriasis flares. Therefore, most doctors tell their patients not to take stress but to try to get the disease under control so that their condition may improve. Hence, understanding the role of stress and targeting it is an important aspect of treating psoriasis.\n",

      "Environmental and genetic factors play an important role in the development of psoriasis. Stress can trigger or aggravate psoriasis, and on the other hand, psoriasis can be stressful. Researchers are of the opinion that stress does not cause psoriasis, but it can flare up the condition in an individual who is already genetically susceptible to it. Patients with psoriasis are also known to have issues with the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, the area that responds to stress in an individual, and lower levels of cortisol hormone, which helps reduce inflammation. Also, stress can increase itching and dryness as it affects the skin barrier and decreases the levels of proteins and lipids in the body, resulting in flares. Chronic stress has been linked to increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines in the blood, which are the same proteins involved in causing psoriasis. Therefore, when psoriasis patients are under stress, it triggers inflammation and flares up the disease, thus worsening the symptoms. \n",

      "According to the National Psoriasis Foundation, approximately one in three people with psoriasis suffer from depression. Recent reports have found that about 98 percent of patients feel that their skin disorder has affected their psychological and emotional well-being, and only around 18 percent seek help. This can be due to limited resources, lack of awareness, and poor or delayed diagnosis. Therefore, managing psoriasis begins with early identification and intervention, and prompt treatment. A holistic approach that includes physical, psychosocial, and psychodermatological aspects can benefit these patients to maximize treatment adherence, achieve effectiveness, and a better quality of life.\n",

Poor sleep can also increase inflammation and worsen psoriasis severity. A close association exists between psoriasis and sleep disorders, but the exact mechanism or pathophysiology is not completely understood. According to a recent study, psoriasis patients have trouble sleeping and an increased risk of sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, etc. \n",
      "The severity of psoriasis, pain, itching, and presence of comorbidities can be the causative factors for sleep disturbances in psoriasis patients. Melatonin plays a significant role in the physiology of the skin, and psoriatic patients are known to have low melatonin levels and lack night-time peak melatonin receptors. Central and peripheral circadian mechanisms are affected, which aggravates skin inflammation. It can be attributed to the increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 and TNF-alpha, which play a vital role in the occurrence of sleep disorders. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate sleep disorders in these patients to maintain physical and psychological health. If sleep disorders are reported, patients are assessed based on the screening questionnaires, triggering factors, duration of insomnia, daytime consequences, and effectiveness of current treatment.\n",

      "Studies have shown that when included along with psoriasis medications, acupuncture can further reduce inflammation and psoriasis symptoms. A meta-analysis study on psoriasis and acupuncture conducted on 590 patients reported that the therapeutic effect of acupoint stimulation is higher than a placebo or nonacupoint stimulation in psoriasis treatment. However, the acupoint stimulation must be conducted for at least six weeks to achieve the therapeutic effect. \n",

      "Cupping Therapy: \n",
      "It is an ancient treatment modality similar to acupuncture and is employed to treat various diseases. There are two types of cupping methods, namely dry and wet, also called Hijama. Glass suction cups are placed directly on the affected body parts, this technique creates a vacuum, and it is believed that the impurities are drawn out from the blood and tissues rather than transferring from one site to another. \n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between dry and wet cupping is that the latter involves a skin incision either before or after the suction. Dry cupping involves the application of a lubricant on the affected area or on the mouth of the glass cup and adsorbing the cup to the desired areas. The glass cup is then moved manually across the skin in different directions by applying light force, which produces flushing, blood flow, and even ecchymosis in some areas. This further results in the local accumulation of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory products with neuromodulatory and antiproliferative effects. \n",

Prevalence rates of psoriasis in children vary based on gender, age, geographical location, etc, and about 30 to 50 percent of adults develop psoriasis before the age of 20 years. Psoriasis can have a long-term impact on the psychological health of children. The majority of pediatric psoriasis cases are mild and usually improve with treatment. However, some pediatric psoriasis patients can also have comorbidities, such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and hyperlipidemia. Management of psoriasis in children can be challenging as most of the systemic treatments are not approved for pediatric use. Therefore, medical treatment of psoriasis in children is mainly based on the guidelines for adult psoriasis, published case report series, and expert opinions and experiences.\n",

      "Though clinical subtypes of psoriasis are the same in adults and children, psoriatic lesions may vary depending on the morphology, differentiation, and clinical symptoms. \n",
      "Pediatric psoriasis lesions are less prominent and characterized by maceration. Typical erythematous plaques are thinner and smaller and mostly appear overlying white scales on the face and flexural areas. Changes in the nails and nail bed or pitting of the nail plate can be seen in 40 percent of cases and are more common in males than females.\n",
      "In infants, it can also be present as a diaper rash that is primarily unresponsive to treatment. It appears as well-demarcated, macerated, erythematous plaques that are minimally elevated, mainly involving inguinal folds, and develop into a widespread eruption within one to two weeks. Oil spots, subungual hyperkeratosis (accumulation of a chalky substance under the nails causing thickening), onychodystrophy (changes in the nail structure), onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed), and splinter hemorrhages (small blood clots under the nails) are some of the other characteristics.\n",
      "In older children, it manifests similar to chronic plaque psoriasis and is characterized by erythematosquamous plaques or papules associated with overlying whitish scales. The lesions differ in size and are mostly seen on the scalp, face, elbows, and knees. In some cases, it can also involve the ear canals and may be misdiagnosed as otitis externa. Other sites of involvement include the upper and lower eyelids, which are often confused with allergic or contact dermatitis.\n",
      "Approximately 75 percent of adolescents have chronic plaque psoriasis, in which the lesions occur as round or oval plaques with silvery white scales, sharply demarcated, symmetrically distributed, and can appear in any area of the body. The scalp is the most common site of occurrence, followed by the elbows and knees. They are mostly red, itchy, painful, and may sometimes bleed. New psoriatic lesions can appear due to a cutaneous trauma and are known as the Koebner phenomenon.\n",
      "Guttate psoriasis, also known as drop-like psoriasis, is the second most common type in children. It occurs as small red spots or papules on the trunk area, arms, back, and legs around two weeks following a beta-hemolytic streptococcal or a viral infection. In some individuals, guttate psoriasis can further develop into plaque psoriasis. However, in most cases, it is self-limiting and may resolve within three to four months after the onset.\n",
      "Pustular psoriasis is a rare type that occurs in approximately 1 to 5.4 percent of children with psoriasis. It is characterized by generalized or localized superficial sterile pustules or red blisters associated with fever, malaise, swollen skin, and joint pain. \n",
      "Inverse psoriasis is a type of psoriasis in children that occurs as red, smooth, and shiny lesions often seen in the folds of the body, such as the armpit, behind the knee, or groin.\n",
      "Another rare type of psoriasis is erythrodermic psoriasis, which manifests as scaling and erythema in about 90 percent of the body surface area. However, it may be associated with severe hypoalbuminemia, hypothermia, and cardiac complications.\n",
      "Juvenile psoriatic arthritis (JPsA) is another type of psoriasis in children; it is estimated that approximately 1 to 10 percent of children with psoriasis and 7 percent of cases with juvenile idiopathic arthritis appear to have juvenile psoriatic arthritis. Skin psoriasis in the absence of rash with associated nail changes is a characteristic feature. It mainly occurs between 9 and 12 years of age and is usually preceded by skin psoriasis. \n",

Long-term skin disorders, especially visible conditions such as psoriasis, significantly impact the external appearance and influence the patient’s self-esteem. As they have an early onset, they affect how the patients perceive themselves and interact with normal individuals. Researchers consider that psoriasis highly influences the self-esteem of the affected one and is accompanied by feelings of embarrassment, shame, and social stigmatization. Though childhood psoriasis has mild variations from adult psoriasis and the severity is less, it has primarily facial involvement, which is an established feature and uncommon in adults. \n",
      "\n",
      "Approximately one-third of patients with psoriasis experience the onset within the first two decades of life. Therefore, the assessment of their psychological well-being is particularly important for the overall health and well-being of these children. Children with psoriasis experience the challenge of coping with the condition due to psychosocial issues and the visibility of skin lesions. Low esteem and poor self-image because of this long-term condition can affect learning and early childhood, thus resulting in a hindrance in self-acceptance and social lives. Children with psoriasis also have a higher risk of comorbidities such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and psychiatric disorders compared to normal children. Therefore, due to the burden of the disease and the associated conditions, early diagnosis and intervention are highly essential in children.\n",
      "Psoriasis involves children in a different situation, which creates emotional trauma and constraints such as restriction of motion and restriction of cognitive activity. Psoriasis lesions in sensitive areas such as palms, soles, and genital areas cause pain, itching, and discomfort affecting their concentration and participation in school activities. Studies have reported that approximately 65 percent of children with psoriasis are stigmatized by insults, bullying, or humiliation, and constant skin peeling and odor affect around 15 to 30 percent of children. This may lead to anxiety, depression, behavioral changes, and apprehension in children with psoriasis. A persistently increased level of anxiety can impair the development, function, and overall personality of children.  \n",

      "A recent multicenter study also reported that many psoriatic patients experience high levels of internalized stigma, which may be associated depending on the severity of the disease, psychological illness, general health, and poor quality of life. These can further influence daily life and lead to lower education and social inhibitions. However, unlike adult psoriasis, there was no association between high levels of internalized stigma and the severity of the disease. However, it is necessary to develop comprehensive strategies to overcome internalized stigma and improve psychosocial health by educating the patients and caregivers, providing regular treatment and psychotherapy, and giving constant support, to increase treatment compliance and enhance the quality of life.\n",

Various studies have revealed that individuals who receive support from their friends, family, and caregivers are likely to be healthier and cope more easily with the difficulties caused by the illness. A better adaptation to chronic illness also involves encouragement and motivation for psoriasis patients to participate in social activities and interactions to overcome the feelings of stigmatization and prevent psychological consequences.\n",

Topical corticosteroids are commonly prescribed according to age groups, and a wide range of these medications is available in different strengths and vehicles.\n",
      "0.05 percent Halobetasol cream and 0.05 percent Clobetasol propionate emulsion are considered to be effective in pediatric plaque psoriasis. However, corticosteroids must be used with caution intermittently or with rotation to prevent potential side effects.\n",
      "Topical administration of vitamin D analogs such as Calcitriol and Calcipotriol has also shown efficacy with minimal side effects in children with psoriasis. Vitamin D analogs can also be used as monotherapy, but they are usually prescribed with topical steroids. However, vitamin D analogs are not recommended in children below two years of age. To improve patient compliance and avoid separate applications, a commercially available formulation containing Calcipotriol and Betamethasone has been developed. \n",
      "Two randomized clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 0.1 percent Tacrolimus applied twice daily in pediatric patients. The results demonstrated substantial improvement within the first 30 days of treatment. However, excessive sun exposure and concomitant treatment with phototherapy must be avoided due to the high risk of lymphoma and skin cancer; further research is also required to study the possible long-term adverse effects.\n",

A retrospective study conducted using phototherapy for a duration of 3.3 months on children of two to 18 years of age with psoriasis revealed up to 51 percent clearance and good response in 41 percent of children. However, the frequency of appointments and logistics can be an issue and may be associated with short-term side effects such as pruritus, blistering, and erythema.\n",
      "Systemic Treatment: It is recommended for children with moderate to severe psoriasis but remains a challenge due to a lack of guidelines and a limited number of clinical trials in this age group. Methotrexate is used in adult patients for treating severe psoriasis, but in children, it is used only for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),  juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and certain malignant conditions. A recent analysis demonstrated the safety and efficacy of oral and subcutaneous Methotrexate in about 25 children with plaque psoriasis. Based on the available evidence, oral or subcutaneous Methotrexate is considered to be used in pediatric patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, and as therapeutic control is achieved, it is necessary to taper the dose to a low maintenance dose to reduce the side effects. Routine administration of Folic acid is also recommended to lower the side effects such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, and abnormal liver function tests. \n",
      "\n",
      "A Recent Study Published in Psoriasis: Targets and Therapy examined liver function abnormalities in psoriasis patients prior to initiating systemic treatments. The research found that these liver function irregularities are more likely linked to the underlying psoriasis itself or associated metabolic conditions, rather than prior treatments. Consequently, the presence of such liver abnormalities should not automatically deter healthcare providers from considering systemic therapies for psoriasis. The study suggests that, with careful monitoring, systemic treatments can be safely administered to patients with baseline liver function test anomalies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The safety and efficacy of retinoids have been demonstrated mainly in pustular and erythrodermic psoriasis. Etretinate which was used previously, has been replaced by its active metabolite, Acitretin. However, it is known to cause side effects such as epistaxis, cheilitis, xerosis, hair loss, skin fragility, and ocular toxicities.  Fumaric acid esters have immunomodulatory effects and are used in adult patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, however, adequate information on its pediatric use is limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Biologics: These are new pharmacological agents that target specific mediators such as TNF-alpha and IL-1223 present in the inflammatory cascade in psoriasis patients. These require less frequent lab monitoring and offer suitable and favorable dosing regimens compared to conventional or systemic therapies. However, these drugs lack international guidelines and may be associated with complications such as tuberculosis, opportunistic infections, lymphomas, and other malignancies. \n",

      "Etanercept, a biological fusion protein and a TNF blocker, is approved in Europe and Canada for treating children over eight years of age with plaque psoriasis. It is known to be well-tolerated but can be associated with short-term side effects such as bronchitis, pharyngitis, and gastroenteritis. Adalimumab, Ustekinumab, and Infliximab are the other biologics that could play a role in treating psoriasis in children.

Pregnant women who are particularly in the first and second-trimester experience symptomatic improvement, and the studies indicate that it is because of an elevation in the levels of immunosuppressive hormones and anti-inflammatory cytokines in pregnant women, contributing to immunomodulation. Intrinsic and inherent immune suppression is noticed in expectant women’s bodies, which enables the fetus to grow and ensures that the fetus does not get rejected by the immune cells. This also benefits psoriasis, which is why a temporary reduction in the symptoms is observed during pregnancy; however, this improvement will be lost postpartum. Several studies have highlighted the prevalence of flare-ups during post partum. \n",
      "\n",
      "Though pregnancy can bring a slight reduction in psoriasis symptoms, it can also have certain risks for maternal and fetal health. Research findings show that psoriasis of severe or moderate grade can lead to gestational hypertension, low birth weight infants, preeclampsia, or even preterm birth. So, it is critically important to keep the disease under control and prevent flare-ups.\n",

      "Psoriasis treatment for pregnant and lactating women needs to be planned cautiously by considering both the risks and benefits. Certain psoriasis treatments or medicine scan have significant impact and harm the pregnancy. Even before planning for pregnancy, certain considerations have to be made to ensure that it does not harm or risk pregnancy. Here are a few such considerations:\n",
      "It is always better to plan pregnancy after inducing remission or after attaining appreciable disease control. This helps minimize the scope for flare-ups while pregnant.    \n",
      "Patients who are on systemic treatments for psoriasis need to stop the therapy and advance to conception. \n",
      "In the case of taking systemic Methotrexate, ensure that the drug-free period before conception is more than three months. This is applicable to both men and women who are planning for pregnancy. \n",
      "For systemic retinoids, the drug-free period before conception should be two years, and that is applicable only to female patients who are planning to get pregnant. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, not all psoriasis treatment choices are risky and unsafe for pregnant and breastfeeding women; clinical research and various studies have revealed that certain psoriasis treatments can be safely continued even during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Let us have a look at some safe treatment strategies : \n",
      "Topical treatments such as emollients, mild to moderate topical steroids, and Dithranol.\n",
      "Systemic treatment with ultraviolet B (phototherapy).\n",
      "\n",
      "Topicals are the first-line choice, followed by phototherapy with UV B. However, for breastfeeding women, ensure that you put in the topical agent only after breastfeeding, and if possible, it’s better not to apply it in the nipple region. Similarly, wash it off thoroughly and then only start feeding the baby. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the above-described treatment modalities, certain other psoriasis management techniques are considered to be relatively safe during pregnancy. The study results with these medicines appear to be relatively favorable for their use in pregnancy. However, they cannot be blindly advised; careful assessment of the risks and benefits of individual cases must be carried out before advising them. Here are some relatively safe choices that can be considered:\n",
      "Typical treatment using highly potent steroids in very limited doses. \n",
      "Topical use of coal tar products (for second and third trimesters).\n",
      "Systemic treatments using cyclosporin.\n",

      "Adjusting therapies in older adults is challenging and requires careful evaluation. As age advances, there might be differences and variations in the way medicines are metabolized and processed. Drug tolerability and immune response to the medicine also vary with aging, which also poses additional complexity to the situation. Therefore, often, the management of psoriasis in elderly people needs a holistic approach. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are more possibilities for drug-to-drug interactions in the elderly than in adults, and managing polypharmacy without compromising symptom relief is another challenge. Some studies have revealed that polypharmacy can not only enhance the risk of drug interactions and adverse outcomes but can also reduce patient compliance and adherence to treatment strategies. So while advising psoriasis treatment to an elderly patient who is already on multiple drug therapies, certain considerations have to be made to ensure both safety and effectiveness:\n",
      "Ensure that the psoriasis medicine does not worsen or aggravate any other health issue that the person is having.\n",
      "Ensure that the psoriasis drug does not interact with the patient's other medicines.\n",
      "A multidisciplinary treatment approach must be considered with different specialist doctors. \n",
      "All these aspects must be thoroughly analyzed and considered before deciding on the drug, and that ensures that the medicines are not just effective but safe for the patient. Studies have revealed that tailoring the therapy to the individual needs and limitations of geriatric patients can significantly reduce the incidence of side effects, unintended outcomes, or worsening of coexisting illness. \n",
      "\n",
      "Topical medicines like steroids, Dithranol, Calcipotriol, Tazarotene, Salicylic acid, and tar preparations are the best treatment choices for elderly patients. Phototherapy using narrowband UV B can also be considered as the second line of treatment. However, drug doses must be tailored to the optimum level that does not burden their kidney and liver. The systemic forms of Cyclosporin, Methotrexate, and Retinoids are more likely to pull off toxicity issues due to reduced therapeutic index, and therefore, the dose must be cautiously determined. These drugs are suggested for elderly patients only when they have severe grades of psoriasis and do not respond well to other treatments.  \n",

Both psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patients will have mobility challenges because of the psoriatic lesions and joint issues. Mobility challenges can make them more dependent, which may significantly impact their quality of life. Research findings also suggested the need for a multidisciplinary approach to address the mobility issues that elderly psoriatic patients have. \n",
      "\n",
      "Several strategies are particularly aimed at addressing and coping with mobility challenges. Incorporating physiotherapy along with medicinal therapy can enhance joint function and help them retain and protect their ability for independent movement. The study findings suggested that the use of anti-inflammatories and analgesics can help in reducing joint swelling and joint pain. Similarly, they can use addictive tools like walkers or special footwear to assist them in walking independently, even if permanent joint damages have crept in. Therefore, both medical and nonmedical aids can help in addressing the mobility issues caused by psoriasis and its complications. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other systemic comorbidities like musculoskeletal issues, cardiovascular diseases, and psychological issues may also develop alongside psoriasis in elderly ones. This association is more prominent in the elderly population than in the adult. Many systemic conditions that emerge through the inflammatory pathways associated with psoriasis also trouble them later on. All these illnesses can make the person sick and ill, affecting their mobility and quality of life. The co-existing illnesses will further worsen the situation, and that is why a holistic approach is preferred when the person has multiple diseases apart from psoriasis. Correct treatment for the comorbidities must be taken to prevent further deterioration of health. Incorporating patient-centered treatment plans that are backed by research findings will definitely help in overcoming the challenges brought out by psoriasis. \n",
      "\n",
      " A recent retrospective study investigated the potential link between psoriasis, a chronic skin condition, and dermatomyositis, an inflammatory disease affecting muscles and skin. The research found that individuals with psoriasis may have a higher risk of developing dermatomyositis compared to those without psoriasis. This suggests that psoriasis patients should be monitored for symptoms of dermatomyositis to ensure early detection and treatment. However, further studies are necessary to confirm this association and understand the underlying mechanisms. Another study explored the molecular interactions involving neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in both cardiovascular disease (CVD) and psoriasis. NETs are web-like structures released by neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, to trap and neutralize pathogens. However, excessive NET formation has been implicated in various inflammatory conditions.​ The research utilized Mendelian randomization, single-cell RNA sequencing, and bioinformatics analyses to investigate the shared pathways between CVD and psoriasis. The findings suggest that NETs may play a pivotal role in the development and progression of both diseases, highlighting potential molecular targets for therapeutic intervention.​\n",

      "\n",
      "Ethnicity: Psoriasis prevalence varies depending on the race and geographical location. It is predominantly common in people of European descent or Western countries. The incidence of psoriasis is significantly higher in many Western countries than globally. Research shows a bimodal pattern of psoriasis manifestation which is type I or early and type II or late onset. A recent study reported the rate of psoriasis in certain racial and ethnic groups as 3.6% in whites, 2.5% in Asians, 1.9% in African Americans, and 1.6 % in Hispanics. The severity proportions of psoriasis were compared between different ethnoracial groups depending on age, age of onset, and gender, which revealed that Asians had significantly more psoriasis than whites. Similarly, Hispanics were found to have more severe psoriasis compared to whites. Though various psoriasis studies focused on the differences between ethnicities, there is very little data about the role of ethnicity in the severity of psoriasis. A *JAMA Dermatology* study explored the experiences of Latine patients in the U.S. with moderate to severe psoriasis. Many lacked awareness of the condition, often misidentifying it, and relied on family for medical advice. Psoriasis significantly impacted their work, especially in manual labor jobs, while barriers like language, cultural differences, and healthcare navigation challenges limited access to dermatologic care. Patients initially preferred natural remedies but later accepted prescribed treatments, favoring injectables. Despite limited exposure to medical research, they were open to participation. The study highlights the need for culturally sensitive care, better education, and increased access to biologic treatments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gender: Psoriasis can equally affect males and females, but the overall estimated similarity in the prevalence is only around four percent. There can be differences in severity, treatment adherence, and comorbidities depending on skin anatomy, and physiological, genetic, hormonal, cultural, ethnic, social, and environmental factors. While some individuals inherit specific genes that are more likely to cause psoriasis, others can develop this condition without any chance of developing this condition. Nail psoriasis is known to be more common in males than females, and on the contrary palmoplantar pustulosis has female predominance. Several small studies have shown that pustular, guttate, and localized plaque psoriasis are more frequent in women than men. Genital involvement, especially in the anogenital areas, occurs in about 59 percent of men and 39 percent of women with psoriasis. However, based on the questionnaires conducted, the intensity of genital psoriasis symptoms is higher in women compared to men.  Men with psoriasis tend to have higher body mass index, smoking rates, alcohol consumption, and later age of onset (≥20 years) compared to women. While women show a higher prevalence of joint involvement and clinical types other than diffuse plaque psoriasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The severity of psoriasis is based on the extent of involvement and its impact on the quality of life of patients. Males exhibit a greater area of psoriatic lesions and have higher psoriasis area severity index (PASI) scores, while females have a more significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) and report more health-related work disability and frequent fatigue than males. Women with psoriasis have more joint affected or polyarthritis, higher levels of pain, worse scores in arthritis-related outcomes, and poor prognosis compared to men. On the contrary, in males,  spondylarthritis is more frequent, and physical impairment and activities are differently affected. The expression of psoriatic arthritis is associated with a genetic background, but males develop more severe radiographic damage, increased restrictions in back movements, and sacroiliitis compared to women. In peripheral psoriatic arthritis, men have improved response and remission, while women have worse functional scores and work disability.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the psychosocial impact, psoriasis can cause negative feelings toward the appearance, which is high and unrelated to the severity in females, but the disease severity can cause negative body-related emotions in males. Females also exhibit an increased risk of psychological distress, higher levels of social inhibition, stigmatization, neuroticism, and negative affectivity compared to males, mainly due to the presence of these skin lesions in visible areas. Women also feel more stressed and worried and show higher frequencies of shame and annoyance, have worse perceptions of body image, and have impaired sexual dysfunction. At the same time, men exhibit more work-related stress and the fear of losing jobs. However, increased social support can help males with better acceptance of the disease, lower depression levels, and a better quality of life in females.\n",

Researchers also require more individuals from multiple areas to be included in the clinical studies so that their data will be more accurate. However, this can be challenging as, many times, people from diverse backgrounds or minority origins are poorly represented in clinical research due to diverse cultures, languages, and a lack of health awareness. Therefore minority populations require more education about the medical conditions, their risks or complications, treatment options available, and clinical trials. \n",
      "\n",
      "Genetic composition and biological background play significant roles in clinical research, as understanding the response to medications, metabolism, and adverse effects is essential. A broader diversity in culture and ethnic backgrounds helps healthcare professionals and researchers understand individual differences. Diversity in psoriasis involves several aspects, such as location, skin color, skin tone, hair texture, and racial and ethnic backgrounds. Understanding these diversities helps curate treatment approaches in a nuanced way to a greater extent.

      "A better genomic and proteomic understanding of psoriasis helped reform and transform its treatment scopes and recovery possibilities. It not only reshaped the treatment aspects but also helped in devising better diagnostics so that the disease can be identified at the earliest and treatment can be initiated at the right time. All these factors count toward better and timely management of psoriasis. That highlights the importance of such research studies and how it contributes to our understanding of psoriasis. These studies are indeed needed to revolutionize the management aspects of psoriasis, thereby shedding light and rays of hope for psoriasis survivors and victims. \n",
      "\n",
      "Genomic Insights:\n",
      "Genomic-wide association studies (GWAS) are the critical units that are involved in bringing out the genetic affiliation of psoriasis. This study has so far identified more than 109 genetic loci that are believed to increase the “psoriatic susceptibility” of an individual. Out of these 109, most of the loci were part of the major histocompatibility complex 1 region, thus making it the strongest and most relevant genetic determinant for psoriasis. The PSORS1 gene locus that is situated on chromosome number 6 is the most relevant and potent psoriatic susceptibility marker gene. \n",
      "\n",
      "While GWAS focuses on the genetic determinants, other non-genetic determinants could also influence the psoriasis progression. Apart from the genetic factors, certain environmental factors also tend to influence psoriasis exacerbation. Such non-genetic determinants were revealed by the epigenetic research. The epigenetic research made it clear that some modifications in the genes without actually deranging the DNA sequence can also impact psoriasis pathogenesis. The epigenetic variations that are associated with psoriatic susceptibility could be histone modifications, non-coding RNA expressions, or changes in the methylation pattern of DNA. All these factors were identified through epigenetic research, which opened the way for novel treatment targets for psoriasis. \n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to GWAS and epigenetic research, certain functional genomic studies also contributed to the understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis. Functional genomic studies flagged the role of the IL23/Th17 pathway and mutated CARD14 gene. More than the psoriasis susceptibility, these determinants signal that they can make the psoriasis worse and more severe. These are also possible leads to futuristic treatments for psoriasis. Advanced omics technologies like transcriptomics also help in distinguishing the psoriasis subtype by identifying the pattern in the gene expression. \n",
      "\n",
      "Proteomic Insights:\n",
      "Just like the genetic findings that can have an impact on psoriasis, protein profiling also leveraged and fostered the understanding and treatment of psoriasis. Studies have identified certain protein panels that help doctors in precisely speculating the disease progression, and at the same time, they can also help in predicting how good the treatment will be for each case. So that personalized and tailor-made therapy can be designed for each psoriasis patient. \n",
      "\n",
      "Proteomic studies have identified that dysregulated proteins can also exacerbate psoriasis by impairing and disrupting the lipid metabolism pathway and oxidative stress. Protein profiling will guide the doctors in choosing which treatment strategy to suggest, thus making the treatment more personalized and apt for individual cases, which can have direct reflections on the therapeutic outcomes. Even the specific drug that can yield the best outcome for each case can be accurately tracked. \n",

      "Biologics work by interrupting the immune component that is responsible for psoriasis, and there are many such biologics in the market that are approved for psoriasis management. Though it had an unmatchable efficacy and appreciable safety profile, the potential concerns were with the administration route. Most biologics that were approved need to be subcutaneously administered, making it an inconvenient choice for patients. Similarly, potential immunogenicity and high cost also necessitated the need for further research, and that led to the development of advanced biologics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Bispecific antibodies, interleukin 17 inhibitors, interleukin 23 inhibitors, interleukin targeted therapy, and anti-interleukin 13 monoclonal antibodies are some of the relevant and promising biologics for psoriasis management.

These small molecule drugs, like JAK inhibitors and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, on the other hand, are designed to be taken orally, which reflects better patient compliance and better adherence to treatment. Both will contribute to therapeutic outcomes. These oral small-molecules are viewed as the future of psoriatic treatment. However, it does have certain setbacks. The impact they can have on long-term use is still under investigation, and they have a greater possibility for systemic side effects. \n",

      "The IL-23/IL-17 axis has emerged as a crucial target, with newer biologics focusing on these pathways. The future of psoriasis treatment looks promising, with a focus on personalized approaches using biomarkers and multi-omics technologies. Now the researchers are focusing on combination therapy, where both biologics and oral small-molecule drugs can be employed together so that the efficacy can be improved while tying down the negative and unwanted outcomes. The combination therapy aims for synergetic outcomes from the individual drug components, which not only reduces the disease burden but it can also optimize the drug dose to the minimum. \n",

      "The recent advances are largely driven by biologic therapies targeting specific immune pathways, such as IL-12/23 inhibitors. These innovations have enhanced symptom management and reduced side effects for psoriasis patients. Additionally, improvements in diagnostic technologies, including biomarker-based diagnostics, artificial intelligence-driven predictive models, and genetic profiling, have enabled earlier and more accurate detection of psoriasis subtypes, facilitating personalized treatment strategies.

      "Psoriasis care is evolving with emerging therapeutics and personalized medicine strategies. It is greatly driven by the extensive research that is ongoing on this topic. At present many researchers are exploring the precision medicine aspects to derive better clinical outcomes and thereby ease the life of psoriasis patients. However, the future directions are not just focused on improving therapeutic outcomes. In addition, it does have the objective of figuring out ways to prevent the development of psoriasis and also to devise more sophisticated and accurate diagnostic targets that can help with early diagnosis when before the clinical signs set in. \n",
      "\n",
      "Research is expected to focus on understanding the disease at molecular, genetic, and immunological levels, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments. Emerging trends in psoriasis treatment include the development of new biologic agents targeting novel pathways, such as interleukin 23 inhibitors, and small molecule inhibitors like RORγt and ROCK2 inhibitors.While biologics have revolutionized psoriasis treatment, limitations such as cost and potential immunogenicity have driven the exploration of alternative treatment modalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost-effectiveness is another factor that has to be considered for the upcoming therapeutics because some of the advanced choices, like biologics, are quite higher on the expense side, which can burden the patient financially, who has already been physically and mentally drained because of the chronic illness. So future research and studies must be focussed on to derive cost-effective therapeutics. Let us look into the future directions in psoriasis care: \n",

      "18.1 Regenerative Therapies and Gene Editing:\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "\n",
      "The scopes of regenerative therapy and gene editing are widely being researched and they could be the future leads in psoriasis management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Regenerative Therapies:\n",
      "Mesenchymal stem cells have the potential to modulate and reshape your immune response, and regenerative therapies utilize this potential for psoriasis management. Research is ongoing on autologous stem cell transplantation to assess its scope for psoriasis treatment so that patient’s own stem cells can be employed to get their damaged skin regenerated and repaired. Thus the inflammatory cascade that keeps the psoriasis progress can be effectively reversed. Apart from mesenchyma stem cell therapies, induced pluripotent stem cell therapy also flags appreciable results in preclinical and early on clinical studies. Regulatory T cells and hematopoietic stem cells are also considered for regenerative therapies. However, they are still under research only, and we can expect them to be available as promising curative therapy for psoriasis in the near future.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Gene Editing:\n",
      "Gene editing is yet another promising therapeutic scope for psoriasis. We know that some genetic elements contribute to psoriasis susceptibility, and those genetic mutations can be corrected by using gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9. Currently, research is on to explore the possibilities and risks of using gene editing for psoriasis. Apart from the psoriasis-associated genes, gene editing can also be considered for modifying cytokine production by editing the gene responsible for it. This can help reduce cytokine overproduction, a potential psoriasis trigger. Gene editing can be promising for reducing the risk of psoriasis in those who are more susceptible. Once psoriasis susceptibility is traced, gene editing can be considered before the actual onset of the skin lesion. It is a great preventive approach that shuts off the possibility of psoriasis, enabling you to have a stress-free life without carrying the fear of psoriasis. This will be particularly advantageous for those with higher genetic risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from regenerative therapies and gene editing, tissue engineering will also come into play in psoriasis management. Unlike the other two, tissue engineering neither contributes to disease prevention nor disease regression. However, tissue engineering techniques can be utilized for generating customized skin grafts using three dimensional bioprinting of skin models. Studies and investigations are ongoing for incorporating immunomodulatory components into the engineered tissues to enhance the treatment outcome and it can also reduce systemic exposure and its adverse effects. \n",

      "18.2 Digital Health Tools: Apps, Wearables, and Telehealth Platforms\n",
      "#article/no - article\n",
      "\n",
      "Technological advancement and digitalization have opened up new scopes for psoriasis management through digital health tools. Digital health solutions are promising and potential gears that are capable of revolutionizing the way psoriasis is being perceived and approached. \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Health Apps for Psoriasis:\n",
      "Several health apps are popping up daily. Apps that can track different aspects of psoriasis are being developed, and many are still under development. These apps are designed to ease life with psoriasis; they can help you track your symptoms and triggers. They can also help you with medicine adherence, and thus, digital health tools can enhance patient compliance. Many such mobile apps are there for psoriasis patients to guide them through and help them monitor their psoriasis flare-ups and progression very effectively with ease and comfort. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mobile apps also help in fostering patient engagement. With the help of these apps, psoriasis patients can access educational resources regarding their illness which thereby help them break their misconceptions. It can also help the patient to make informed decisions regarding their treatments. Many psoriatic apps also help patients connect with their support communities. Engaging with other psoriasis patients who have a similar story can boost the patient’s mental strength, and it makes the patient feel that they are not alone in this journey, which is much needed while fighting such an emotionally draining illness like psoriasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Wearable Gadgets for Empowering the Journey With Psoriasis:\n",
      "Wearable devices are another major integrant of digital health solutions for psoriasis management. Wearable devices are being designed to detect the early signs of psoriasis, which is particularly useful for those at high genetic risk of developing it. Biomarkers like cytokine levels can be monitored by these wearables, which is made possible with the help of embedded biosensors. In addition, these devices can also help assess the treatment response by tracking certain biomarkers, which help both the patient and doctor understand how well the body is responding to the current therapeutic regimen, and if the improvement is not appreciable, then they can consider changing the therapeutic choice. Many such wearables also provide provisions to set alarms or reminders for taking medicine, which foster medicine adherence and better treatment compliance. \n",
      "\n",
      "3. Telehealth Platforms:\n",
      "We can see that the has been a boom in the emergence of telehealth platforms, and that has really contributed to healthcare accessibility. Psoriasis patients from remote locations are not left with no access to healthcare, but with telemedicine platforms, anybody from anywhere can have better access to health consultations. This has prompted many psoriasis patients to get in touch with medical experts and get their condition diagnosed even when physical access to healthcare is not that easily available. This also provides provision for the patient to get a multidisciplinary approach to psoriasis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Advancements like AI-powered diagnostics have also contributed to better diagnosis of psoriasis with the image of the psoriatic lesions that the patient uploads. The healthcare that was earlier accessible only physically is now a click away. This provision has increased the diagnosis rate of psoriasis, as many patients who actually don't have access to medical facilities or those who are reluctant to have an in-person consultation for their skin condition can get them diagnosed virtually or through online consultations. Digital health innovations can take psoriasis management to the next level and can enhance the patient’s quality of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "18.3 Preventive Strategies and Early Intervention:\n",
      "#article/psoriasis-prevention\n",
      "Prevention is equally important as treatment, and at times, prevention should be given more emphasis than treatment because the right preventive strategies and measures can keep the disease onset and severity under control. With the advancement in genomic profiling techniques, the scope for identifying psoriasis susceptibility and, thereby, those at risk has been heightened. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many studies are still exploring techniques to identify more genetic components and determinants that can tell about your psoriasis susceptibility. With the introduction of more sophisticated interventional strategies, many at-risk can be monitored more effectively so that psoriasis can be detected at its budding stage, widening the scope for getting better disease control and a better quality of life for them. Immunomodulator therapies are also at the front line for the prevention of psoriasis. \n",
      "\n",
      "Making appropriate changes in dietary choices, like incorporating food with anti-inflammatory properties, has also proven to be an effective preventive measure. It can also help with flare-up prevention. Certain recent studies have also highlighted that vitamin D can also help with psoriasis through its immunomodulation properties. \n",
      "\n",
      "Educating the public on the pertinence of preventive measures and early treatment is another aspect that can definitely enhance the diagnosis. Various social media platforms and other visual media have also contributed to making society more aware of psoriasis and how people can protect themselves even if they are genetically at risk for developing it. \n",
      "\n",
      "For those who have greater psoriasis susceptibility, even if they have not yet been diagnosed, they have to go through immense stress and anxiety. These can emotionally pull them down and even deepen their risk as stress is identified as a trigger for psoriasis. So offering mental health support is not meant just for psoriasis patients, but it should also be considered for those at risk. \n",
      "\n",
      "If diagnosed taking up the right treatment at the earliest does matter with disease intensity and limiting the disease progression. Low-dose systemic medicines, topicals, and UVB phototherapy, can be considered as early on interventions, and they can help restrict the worsening of psoriasis. Early intervention not only prevents disease progression but at the same time it also reduces the likelihood of developing psoriasis-associated complications or other comorbidities that can even worsen their quality of life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention and early intervention strategies are being revolutionized with the advancement of health technology and the emergence of AI-based health tools. In the upcoming years, we can expect many more novel and sophisticated tools to effectively predict and tackle psoriasis. These together help reduce the disease burden that psoriasis used to have and can contribute to a better quality of life for psoriasis patients. \n",
