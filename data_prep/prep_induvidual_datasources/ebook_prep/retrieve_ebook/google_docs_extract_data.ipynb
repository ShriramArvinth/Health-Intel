      "1.1 Introduction to Type 1 Diabetes \n",
      "You may have heard of diabetes very often, and many of you may have even encountered diabetes during routine checkups. Getting diagnosed and spotted with diabetes could be devastating and disturbing for you, me, and anybody; however, panicking and distressing cannot bring about any productive outcome other than inflaming and worsening the condition deteriorating mental health. Instead of hampering mental peacefulness, you must draw in a clear understanding and comprehension of the medical state that has subjugated you or your loved ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "A better comprehension of what has stroked you can make you more acclimatized to the diseased state. Such understanding often opens up proactive measures that you can take to combat and mitigate the risk aspects. Understanding diabetes should start with the type of diabetes spotted in you. Not all diabetes subsets are of the same type and features. The causal attributes of each diabetes subtype, their manifestations, and managerial strategies differ. \n",
      "\n",
      "Diabetes has often been employed to denote all medical states where the blood glucose expresses appreciable inflation compared to what is expected and perceived to be normal. The term is often denominated for all the diabetes subtypes, irrespective of the causative factor. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are two discrete diabetes subsets instigated by their distinct etiologies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Getting diagnosed with type 1 diabetes is never the end of your life; take up the courage and look for prompt therapeutic choices that could mitigate the disease burden inflicted by type 1 diabetes. You might be completely heartbroken and disheartened while getting diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and some people may even question their existence. However, don't be demoralized; keep your inner soul motivated. To be frank, modern technological advances concerning type 1 diabetes have eased and streamlined the journey with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, you should stop worrying about it and focus on the measures to get it tackled and managed without hampering your quality of life. \n",

      "1.2 What Is Type 1 Diabetes? \n",
      "First, type 1 diabetes can be elucidated as a condition where your body tends to express a remarkable downturn in insulin liberation. Insulin is the hormonal component in your body assigned to downturn the blood's glucose proportion during blood sugar spikes. The pancreas is the organ concerned with insulin liberation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sugar spikes occur following food intake, particularly with sugary or carb-rich food. Such sugar spikes can trigger and turn on your body's insulin liberation. The released insulin hormone then guides and channels the sugar molecules from the circulation into the cells, which are then uptaken and employed for energy liberation within the cells. \n",
      "Depletion in insulin liberation is underscored in type 1 diabetes. As a result, the sugar spikes prompted following food intake remain inflated and exaggerated, which can pose cellular harm and negative effects on your body. \n",
      "\n",
      "# articles/diabetes-health/differences-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes\n",
      "1.3 How Does It Differ From Type 2 Diabetes?\n",
      "You may find and perceive both type 1 and type 2 diabetes to be overlapping and confusing; however, they are discrete entities with distinguishable causal attributes despite projecting an analogous clinical picture of elevated blood sugar levels. Type 1 diabetes is often encountered during the early phase, particularly during the juvenile or childhood stage. However, at times, you may encounter type 1 diabetes in a later stage as well. Well, type 2 diabetes is more of a lifestyle condition that is brought about and exacerbated by unhealthy lifestyles and food habits. Hence, it manifests and is expressed later in life. \n",
      "\n",
      "Type 1 diabetes, surprisingly, is more genetically inclined where certain genetic elements are being perceived and underscored to gravitate one to type 1 diabetes. Immunological components are involved in type 1 diabetes, which is not appreciated with type 2 diabetes. The wrongly and aberrantly directed immune cells strike and put up a war with the cellular insulin-producing entities, which are the pancreatic islet cells, inflicting cellular mutilation and harm. \n",
      "\n",
      "This, in turn, gears down the insulin liberation, prompting overstated blood sugar proportions as the insulin is insufficient to pull off the sugar load from the circulation. This is how type 1 diabetes is instigated. In type 2 diabetes, the cellular resistance against the insulin hormone is the driving force, which prompts inefficient insulin utility. However, you may also encounter depletion or palliation in insulin liberation when age advances over 40. Both these team up to bring out type 2 diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "A complete cure cannot be attained for type 1 diabetes, while it is possible for type 2 diabetes when diagnosed timely and approached with prompt interventional modalities. However, you do not need to be disheartened upon getting type 1 diabetes, and insulin therapy can be employed to cope with and combat the deficit in intrinsic insulin liberation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another aspect that aids in distinguishing both type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes is the impact that preventive strategies could have on disease development. Owing to its genetic inclination, you cannot completely shut off the propensity for type 1 diabetes through preventive steps. On the other hand, you can control and turn down the propensity for type 2 diabetes by fostering a healthy lifestyle and food habits. \n",

      "1.4 Prevalence and Statistics\n",
      "\n",
      "Global Statistics of Type 1 Diabetes:\n",
      "The global statistics concerning type 1 diabetes are quite alarming and upsetting. Many studies have explored the statistical aspects of type 1 diabetes, and the global prevalence was estimated to be nine million. \n",
      "\n",
      "Out of the total diabetes cases, the prevalence rate for type 1 diabetes alone accounts for five to 10 percent. While the incidence rate for type 1 diabetes is estimated to be 1.2 million, reports are demonstrating an upward trend in the global incidence rate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Likewise, type 1 diabetes can downturn the life expectancy and longevity aspects of the affected ones if not promptly addressed with medical strategies. This underscores the gravity of therapeutic interventions in combating type 1 diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The global prevalence of diabetes in adults, estimated at 4.0% in 1995, is projected to rise to 5.4% by 2025, with a significant increase in developing countries. The number of diabetic adults is expected to grow from 135 million in 1995 to 300 million by 2025, with over 75% residing in developing nations. \n",
      "\n",
      "Diabetes will be more prevalent in urban areas, affecting middle-aged adults in developing countries and older adults in developed ones. Women, particularly in developed countries, will have higher rates than men. Global diabetes surveillance is crucial for effective prevention and control.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regional Statistics of Type 1 Diabetes:\n",
      "You might be surprised to learn that regional statistics of type 1 diabetes tend to be influenced and governed by geographical locations. The peak incidence was recorded in Finland, the United States, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany. The annual incidence rate in the United States reflected an upward trend estimated to be gearing up at one to three percent. \n",
      "\n",
      "The incidence and prevalence rate of type 1 diabetes are much more pronounced and underscored in Northern Europe than in Southern Europe. The incidence rates in Western Europe range midway between those of Northern and Southern Europe—over 20 to 25 per one lakh child population. \n",
      "\n",
      "The United States and Canada also exhibit appreciable annual incidence rates among the North American countries: 23.5 per one lakh and 21.7 per one lakh, respectively. African countries experienced a prevalence of low to moderate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Australia and New Zealand also expressed appreciable T1D incidence rates, with statistical values of 23 and 18 per one lakh, respectively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Incidence rates were reported to be minimal in East Asian countries, with statistical values ranging from one to two per one lakh child population. While in Middle East countries, type 1 diabetes incidence rates range between high and moderate.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Lower incidence or prevalence rates don't necessarily imply that the population in that area is less inclined to type 1 diabetes. They could also be prompted by the absence of proper diagnostic aids in those geographic areas, where larger diseased populations remain occult and undiagnosed. Let us dive into the prevalence expressed in African countries. Though the general prevalence rate is estimated to be moderate to low, appreciable prevalence is concurrently reflected in relatively urbanized parts of Africa. \n",

      "1.5 Demographic Attributes of Type 1 Diabetes\n",
      "When we explore the attributes of the population and geographical regions that are more inclined to type 1 diabetes, we can determine that certain specific demographic attributes tend to gravitate toward type 1 diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let's explore the demographic attributes that are inclined to type 1 diabetes development:\n",
      "\n",
      "Age: Age is a critical and key demographic attribute of type 1 diabetes. Younger populations, particularly adolescents and children, are the specific age groups that exhibit a pronounced inclination toward type 1 diabetes. Rarely, type 1 diabetes does crop up in adult ones, which might get misdiagnosed as type 2 diabetes. However, the propensity for type 1 diabetes in adults is inferior to that in younger ones. \n",
      "Ethnicity: Certain ethnic groups have a deeper propensity for type 1 diabetes. Non-Hispanic whites are a specific group that is more inclined to type 1 diabetes. Countries with a Caucasian population exhibited upscaled type 1 diabetes incidence and prevalence than those with non-Caucasians. African Americans and Hispanic Americans are the next two ethnic groups that stand behind non-Hispanic Caucasians concerning type 1 diabetes prevalence and incidence. \n",
      "Socioeconomic Status: A population of low socioeconomic background, particularly of middle—or lower-income countries, tends to express comparatively minimal type 1 diabetes prevalence. On the other hand, higher-income countries elicited appreciable incidence rates. This disparity in the prevalence might reflect the access to healthcare amenities and the scope for diagnosis, which is more pronounced in high-income countries. \n",
      "Gender: Type 1 diabetes is not greatly governed by gender. Both males and females can develop type 1 diabetes. However, certain study reports point out that males are more inclined to it than females. Geographical variations are also elicited, where the gravity for type 1 diabetes is augmented in females of specific geographical ecosystems.\n",
      "Familial Inclination: The propensity for type 1 diabetes is heightened in those with a familial inclination for the condition. In case the child's parents, siblings, or grandparents are recognized to be type 1 diabetes patients, then the scope for type 1 diabetes in that child will be deeper and more pronounced.  \n",

      "2.2 Historical Theories About Diabetes\n",
      "\n",
      "The historical theories about diabetes might keep you fascinated and amused. Interestingly, even without sophisticated medical aids, the ancient physicians derived discernible findings of diabetes. There are several historical theories concerning diabetes, many of which date back a long time. Over time, with medical advancement, modifications and revisions in the theories came in. The evolution of the theories and their revisions, however, came in gradually but yet progressively. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let us explore some of the relevant historical theories concerning diabetes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Humoral Theory: \n",
      "During the 5th century BCE, the first theoretical concept concerning diabetes came in: the humoral theory. Galen and Hippocrates, great physicians, propounded the humoral theory for diabetes. According to humoral theory, the healthy state of the body is attributed to a critical balance of certain elements, namely, phlegm, black bile, blood, and yellow bile. It is perceived that derangement in any of these critical elements in the body gets expressed as a diseased state. Diabetes was perceived to be inflicted by the derangements in the phlegm. \n",
      "\n",
      "Madhumeha:\n",
      "In the same historical era, Indian physicians propounded a different theoretical version of diabetes, documented in Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. Madhumeha was the name quoted for the condition, considering the urine sweetness in such persons. In the 5th century BCE, no specific diagnostic interventions could identify the sweetness in the urine. However, the physicians recognized that this particular disease entity could turn the urine sweet. This conclusion was derived by analyzing why the ants and flies were attracted and drawn to the urine of those individuals. \n",
      "\n",
      "Aretaeus Hypothesis: \n",
      "A renowned physician, Aretaeus of Cappadocia, proposed a more defined and comprehensive understanding of diabetes. He is from the late Hellenistic period and is being recognized for naming the condition diabetes. His hypothesis pointed out that body mass (flesh) gets condensed and liquidized, which gets expelled through the urine. “Melting down of the flesh into the urine” was the phrase he employed to denote this, but he could not recognize and discern the cause that triggered and prompted this melting down. \n",
      "\n",
      "Galen's Theory: \n",
      "Galen, a Greek physician, also came up with another hypothesis. He propounded that diabetes is inflicted by aberrant kidney functions and categorized it as a rare kidney disease. However, Galen's theory concerning diabetes turned out to be incorrect, as the association that diabetes has with sugar was disregarded and not considered in his postulate. \n",
      "\n",
      "Avicenna's Theory:\n",
      "Avicenna suggested that an exaggerated appetite inflicts diabetes. He postulated that excess hunger is responsible for the downscaling of the body weight, weakening, and emaciation that often accompany diabetes. However, he could not substantiate the cause that has prompted excess hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern Theories:\n",
      "In 1674, Thomas Willis revived the diabetes theory by underscoring and augmenting the association between diabetes and sugars. He was successful in discerning diabetes from other medical states that could also bring out exaggerated urination. It was Thomas Willis who first spotlighted the sugar connection in diabetes and proposed the term diabetes mellitus. \n",
      "\n",
      "Claude Bernard spotted and brought out a more appreciable connection between diabetes and sugar metabolism. However, he propounded that the overstated blood sugar prompted by diabetes is inflicted by the exaggerated sugar production by the liver cells. All these developments happened in the 1850s. \n",
      "\n",
      "In 1869, Langerhans rooted out the pancreatic cells concerned with insulin production, which improved understanding of diabetes. However, Langerhans could not provide much information concerning the functional attributes of these pancreatic cells. Only later did their role in insulin production unfold.\n",
      " \n",
      "# articles/no-article\n",
      "2.3 First Descriptions and Medical Records\n",
      "Ebers Papyrus:\n",
      "Ebers Papyrus, an Egyptian manuscript, is recognized to be the first written record about the medical condition of diabetes today. This medical recording was estimated to have been charted in 1550 BCE (before the common era). Though Ebers Papyrus has been quoted as the very first citation for diabetes, it is surprising that you cannot find the term diabetes anywhere in the manuscript. Rather, the condition was being labeled with its associated symptoms. “Too great emptying of urine” is the symptom that the manuscript quoted. Therefore, this manuscript underscores that since 1550 BCE, Egyptians were well informed of this medical state that invoked an exaggerated urination tendency. \n",
      "\n",
      "Indian Vedic Records: \n",
      "Certain Indian Vedic texts also quoted the ancient description concerning diabetes in 500 BCE. Charaka Samhita and Sushrita Samhita are two such Indian Vedic texts that have quoted descriptions of diabetes. However, just like the Egyptian manuscripts, Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita also do not quote the term diabetes for that medical condition; instead, it was coined as madhumeha (honey urine), which is a Sanskrit denomination. The condition was labeled as madhumeha because the urine of those affected by this condition will turn sweet. These Indian Vedic texts underscored that madhumeha is more inclined toward sugar intake through diet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Arteasus Treatises: \n",
      "By the first century CE (common era), a Greek physician, Arteasus, first proposed the diagnosis of diabetes. He instituted the phrase “melting down of flesh into urine” to describe it. His medical recordings also elaborated on and discussed the unreasonable palliation in body weight and overstated urination tendency. \n",

      "Though the pancreatic cells were discerned by Langerhans in 1869, insulin took a few more years to get discovered. The insulin discovery is still being designated and entitled as a breakthrough and revolutionary development in diabetes management. Only when the insulin and its role were discerned did the actual etiology that has prompted diabetes come into the picture; till then, type 1 diabetes was denominated as a grave condition that could critically downturn the person's life expectancy. The early 20th century witnessed this remarkable discovery that has completely uplifted the therapeutic possibilities in combating diabetes. Colwell even quoted the era before insulin discovery as the pre-insulin era, where the therapeutic strategies employed for diabetes were unproductive and pointless. \n",

      "2.5 Discovery by Frederick Banting and Charles Best\n",
      "Dr. Frederick Banting and Dr. Charles Best are the critical minds that worked out and turned up the insulin discovery. The discovery happened at the University of Toronto. Dr. Banting was excited and moved by the research works of Moses Barron, Ssobolew, Arnozan, E. L Scott, and Vaillard on pancreatic islet cells. However, most scholars still need to isolate and disconnect the Langerhans islands. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, Dr. Banting cleared the isolation step, which facilitated insulin discovery. Well, it was Dr. Banting's enthusiasm and urge that paved the way for insulin discovery. Once he succeeded in segregating and disengaging the Langerhans islands from the other pancreatic cells, his next intent was to get the Langerhans islands' secretion isolated and collected. Dr. Charles Best was supposed to assist and help Dr. Banting in his research on extracting the Langerhans island's secretion. Dr. Banting and Dr. Best, thus, successfully extracted and drew out the liquid secretion by employing a specific technique formulated by Dr. Banting. \n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from Dr. Banting and Dr. Best, a few more scholars should also be recognized for their contribution to insulin discovery. Nobel, MacLeod, and Collid are three of them. Dr. Banting and Dr. Best tried the insulin study in animals, and as it turned out to be successful, MacLeod extended the license for human experiments. The outcome of human experimentation with the pancreatic extract brought out surprising results. Hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and ketonuria expressed appreciable downfalls with the pancreatic extract. \n",

Till then, type 1 diabetes was perceived to be an alarming and grave medical state, with no curative therapy available to combat it. Since its discovery, insulin therapy has been recognized as the hallmark and key therapeutic strategy for type 1 diabetes. Insulin therapy could counter the deficit in insulin production that has prompted type 1 diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The longevity attributes of those with type 1 diabetes showed remarkable upturns with insulin therapy. The quality of life also increased with insulin therapy. With insulin, diabetes management was made much easier and simpler than it was once. Initially, animal insulin was extracted and processed for therapeutic use in humans. Though animal-derived insulins are effective, they are more prone to allergic responses. By the 1980s, synthetic human insulin came into the picture, shutting off animal-derived insulins' risk prospects. \n",
      "\n",

      "The evolution of treatment methods for diabetes can be categorized into two specific periods: - pre insulin era and the insulin era. The treatment possibilities in both of these periods differ greatly. With insulin discovery, the entire therapy regimen for diabetes witnessed revolutionary revisions and upliftments, which even downturned the dynamics of the disease progression. \n",
      "\n",
      "Historical Treatment Methods:\n",
      "Historical treatment methods entail the ancient therapeutic modalities employed and practiced for combating diabetes, particularly in the pre-insulin era. Let us explore some of the historical treatment methods that have been in practice long back:\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the historical treatment methods for diabetes were more or less dietary adjustments rather than pharmacological strategies. The ancient Egyptians proposed a whole grain-rich diet as a therapeutic strategy. In ancient Greece, restricting and mitigating dietary intake was instituted as a therapeutic measure. \n",
      "\n",
      "Later, the starvation method came in, where the individuals were instructed to delimit their calorie intake to less than 450 calories per day. Dr. Frederick proposed this treatment method. However, starvation brings out malnutrition and nutritional deficits, further hampering the individual's general health profile. Similarly, the life expectancy also does not express appreciable improvement with the starvation method, despite the improvement in blood sugar proportions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Certain Indian Vedic texts advocated the use of herbal formulations to combat diabetes. Exercises were also employed as a historical treatment method. In addition, opium, which is a narcotic, was also instituted as a therapeutic scope during the ancient days to tackle the manifestations of diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, none of the historic treatment methods were proven to be effective, which is why type 1 diabetes was perceived to be a grave disease until the discovery of insulin and insulin therapies. \n",
      "\n",
      "Progression to Modern-Day Treatment:\n",
      "Diabetes management took a drift with insulin discovery. The progression to modern-day antidiabetic therapeutics does not crop up overnight. Despite the many historical treatment strategies instituted to mitigate thirst and the incessant urination that diabetes has prompted, none have mitigated the manifestations appreciably. With insulin discovery, diabetes management kicked off its progression to modern therapeutics. Apart from insulin discovery, other factors, like technological advancements, augment the progression and advancement in diabetes management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Insulin therapy also witnessed breakthrough advancements in due course. Initially, animal-derived insulins were employed to balance out the intrinsic insulin deficit. Though the sugar spikes and hyperglycemic states palliated with such therapies, the propensity for allergies encountered remained notable and strange. Later, synthetic human-derived insulin took over the position of animal-derived insulins. Since these are human-derived, the scope for overstated sensitivity issues was nominal, thus marking down the risk prospects concerned with diabetes management. \n",
      "\n",
      "Technological progression also aided the constitution of insulin formulations like short-acting and long-acting. Likewise, insulin delivery strategies have improved. Over the last few years, insulin injections, pumps, pens, and several novel delivery modalities have existed.

      "Recently, various new medications and regimens for diabetes, obesity, and diabesity are exhibiting promising results in advanced clinical trials. Some of these include Teplizumab, Ustekinumab, Jakinibs, and cell therapies for managing type 1 diabetes. The FDA’s 2022 approval of Teplizumab marks a key milestone in type 1 diabetes treatment. Immunomodulators like Teplizumab (Tzield) is a humanized anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, recently investigated for its potential to delay the onset of T1DM in individuals at high risk. Clinical trials show it reduces C-peptide decline and insulin dependence, with benefits lasting up to seven years. Despite FDA approval for children over 8, high costs and limited data on advanced disease restrict widespread use. A phase 2 trial showed that a 14-day IV regimen delayed disease onset by a median of two years, with 50% of treated patients remaining diabetes-free after extended follow-up compared to 22% of the placebo group. Other investigational immunotherapies, such as antigen-based GAD-alum vaccines and abatacept (a costimulation modulator), have shown limited or temporary effects in slowing beta-cell decline, highlighting the need for further research.\n",

      "A randomized, double-blind crossover trial evaluated Semaglutide as an adjunct to automated insulin delivery in adults with type 1 diabetes. Semaglutide increased time in the target glucose range by 4.8 percentage points (P = 0.006) without raising hypoglycemia risk. No severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis occurred, though two cases of euglycemic ketosis were noted. These findings suggest Semaglutide may enhance glycemic control with automated insulin delivery.\n",

      "Managing type 1 diabetes in children using a reinforcement learning strategy based on a de Bruijn graph, a tool traditionally used in genomics and proteomics for pattern detection. By translating continuous blood glucose signals into symbolic sequences, the graph helps identify and predict blood glucose states, including impending hypoglycemia. This method enables clinicians to anticipate hypoglycemic episodes up to 30 minutes in advance, providing sufficient time for preventive action. The approach also generates actionable rules for better diabetes management, addressing the complexities of pediatric diabetes, where conventional adult models often fail.\n",

      "Section 3 - Causes and Risk Factors \n",
      "The primary cause of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is the destruction or abnormality of the pancreas's insulin-producing beta cells due to an autoimmune reaction. This process can happen over several months or years, eventually leading to deficiency or lack of insulin. The condition further causes a person to become insulin-dependent, and they require lifelong insulin therapy to avoid associated complications, such as diabetes ketoacidosis (excess production of blood acids, electrolyte balance, and fluids).\n",

      "3.1 Risk Factors for Predisposition of Type 1 Diabetes:\n",
      "\n",
      "Genetics\n",
      "Type 1 diabetes follows a polygenic inheritance pattern, which involves the contribution of various genes to the risk of this condition. However, other risk factors, apart from genes, pose the risk of T1D. Following are some of the genetic factors responsible for T1D:\n",
      "A person's family history, such as a sibling or parent, already has T1D, which can increase the risk of developing the same type of condition. If both parents suffer from T1D, the risks are even higher. \n",
      "Genetic markers are also strongly linked to an increased risk of type 1 diabetes. If a person has human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes, its specific variants include HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, and HLA-DRB1. These gene variants play a crucial role in the immune system as they provide instructions for protein production, help identify between self and non-self, and thus increase the T1D risk by making the immune system more likely to attack beta cells in an individual.\n",
      "In addition, other genetic variants (non-HLA genes), such as the one affecting immune response (IL2RA), the one that encodes insulin (INS), and those involved in immune regulation (PTPN22), also predispose to the risk of type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "Environmental Triggers: Apart from genetic predisposition, environmental triggers or factors, such as viral infections and other factors, are believed to be involved in causing type 1 diabetes. Therefore, these triggers have been discussed below in detail:\n",
      "Viral Infections: These infections cause an autoimmune response leading to type 1 diabetes. For example, prenatal triggers like maternal enteroviral infection (caused by coxsackievirus B virus) and congenital rubella (rubella virus infection) infection can cause inflammation or destruction of the islet of Langerhans (that contain beta cells).\n",
      "Abnormal Gut Microbiome: Healthy gut microbiota greatly influences the immune system, helping it mature in the early stages of life. Therefore, any disruption or abnormality in the gut microbiota can affect the immune system, further destroying pancreatic beta cells and leading to type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "Dietary Factors: Low vegetable intake and vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy are also linked to the development of T1D, as they help regulate the immune system. Additionally, early exposure to cow's milk, root vegetables, cereals, gluten, and a lack of breastfeeding can also be a potential risk for developing type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "Pollution: Autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, can also occur due to various environmental pollutants (heavy metals and pesticides), which affect the function of the immune system.\n",
      "Seasonal Changes: These climate changes and the occurrence of seasonal infections due to bacteria or viruses may also affect the immune system and predispose a person to type 1 diabetes.\n",
      "Physical or Psychological Stress: Stress of any kind disrupts the immune system and can increase the risk of type 1 diabetes by making blood glucose management more challenging.\n",
      "Other Promoter Progression: These include factors like puberty, overweight or obesity, steroid treatment, maternal age, hygiene, and insulin resistance, which may be a possible environmental factor causing type 1 diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Type 1 diabetes, therefore, develops from a potential interaction of genetic, immune, and environmental factors; thus, understanding its complexity is essential to developing preventive treatment strategies. Moreover, this interrelationship between triggers or factors responsible for T1D requires more intensive research for discovering treatments and clarifying the relationship between them.\n",

      "3.2 Autoimmune Response\n",
      "The immune system generally recognizes and kills foreign bodies that may cause disease or infection. However, in the case of type 1 diabetes, the key feature of the condition is the body's autoimmune attack on the pancreatic beta cells, which have been identified as harmful. \n",
      "This autoimmune response involves the following process:\n",
      "The beta cells of the pancreas are mistakenly identified as foreign bodies by the immune system, possibly due to some risk factors, such as viral infections, environmental triggers, or genetic factors.\n",
      "The immune system releases and activates a type of white blood cell called T-cells, along with other immune cells, to target and destroy the beta cells of the pancreas as they are mistakenly believed to be harmful.\n",
      "These activated immune system cells, such as cytotoxic T-cells and macrophages, then move to the pancreas to identify and attack the pancreatic beta cells by releasing inflammatory cytotoxins and other products. This process causes beta cell destruction over time, followed by reduced or eliminated insulin production in the pancreas.\n",
      "Further, destroying beta cells leads to decreased insulin production, which increases blood sugar levels and causes type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the disease progresses due to continuous beta-cell destruction if the condition is left untreated. This requires the type 1 diabetes patient to manage their blood sugar levels, potentially with insulin therapy.\n",
      "Therefore, to manage type 1 diabetes, it is essential to understand its immune mechanism, which would help in developing new treatment modalities for preserving the pancreatic beta cells by modulating the immune response. However, this is a very complex process, and therefore, current research is still underway, focusing on various aspects of the T1D immune mechanism. The research aims to identify the specific immune cells responsible for beta cell destruction and carry out potential targeting. The research also focuses on discovering vaccines and regenerative therapies to fight this autoimmune response and secure the function of beta cells effectively.\n",

      "These symptoms are:\n",
      "Toilet (Frequent Urination): One of the hallmark symptoms is frequent urination, mainly at night. This happens because the body tries to expel extra glucose through urine, leading to a considerable increase in urination frequency. In people with type 1 diabetes, the kidneys are crushed by the high glucose stages and produce extra urine to flush out the extra sugar.\n",
      "Thirsty (Excessive Thirst): Excessive thirst, or polydipsia, is another important symptom. As the body loses more water via common urination, it becomes dehydrated, prompting an insatiable thirst. Individuals can also find themselves ingesting more fluids than traditional, but the thirst stays unrelieved.\n",
      "Tired (Fatigue): Persistent fatigue or a lack of strength is not unusual. The body is predicated on glucose as a primary source of strength. Without enough insulin to assist glucose input in the cells, the body cannot effectively use glucose, leading to feelings of constant tiredness and exhaustion.\n",
      "Thinner (Unexplained Weight Loss): Unexplained weight loss, regardless of an elevated urge for food, is a significant indicator. Without adequate insulin, the body starts breaking down fat and muscle to compensate for the shortage of available glucose for strength. This ends in weight reduction, even though the character's urge for food has improved.\n",

      "5.4 Differentiating Type 1 from Type 2 Diabetes\n",
      "Definition\n",
      "Type 1 Diabetes: Type 1 diabetes occurs because of an autoimmune response. In this condition, the immune system attacks the insulin-producing beta cells. Therefore, insulin is not produced, and the body can not use glucose without insulin, leading to increased glucose levels in the blood. \n",
      "\n",
      "Type 2 Diabetes: This type of diabetes is characterized by the body's inability to use insulin properly (becoming resistant to insulin) or the pancreas's inability to produce sufficient insulin, which leads to increased blood sugar levels. \n",
      "\n",
      "Prevalence\n",
      "Type 1 Diabetes: Among individuals with diabetes, about 8 percent of people present with this type. This type usually occurs in children but can also occur in adults.  A strong type I interferon (IFN) signature, particularly IFN-α, may serve as a risk  for Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Transcriptomic studies on genetically at-risk children show elevated IFN responses even before autoantibody development. \n",
      "\n",
      "In pancreatic islets of recent-onset T1D patients, increased IFN-stimulated gene expression and HLA-I hyper-expression are observed, possibly triggered by viral infections, such as Coxsackievirus B. These early immune changes, driven by IFN-α, may contribute to β-cell destruction and autoimmune activation, making IFN-α a potential biomarker for predicting T1D onset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Type 2 Diabetes: This type is more common than type 1 diabetes. Among individuals with diabetes, around 90 % of people present with this type. This condition usually occurs in adults but can occur in children, too. \n",
      "\n",
      "Presentation\n",
      "Both forms of diabetes manifest similar symptoms, such as excessive thirst, frequent urination, increased hunger, slow healing of wounds, fatigue, unexplained weight loss, tingling or numbness of extremities, blurred vision, irritability, mood changes, itchy skin, and recurrent infections. \n",
      "\n",
      "But notable differences include:\n",
      "Type 1 Diabetes: The onset of symptoms in type 1 diabetes occurs rapidly and can intensify quickly. If the treatment is delayed, it can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, which is an emergency condition. \n",
      "Type 2 Diabetes: The onset of symptoms in type 2 diabetes occurs gradually. In some cases, the symptoms are very mild, and may not experience any symptoms until there are complications. \n",
      "\n",
      "Testing\n",
      "Diagnosing type 1 and type 2 diabetes includes accessing symptoms, reviewing medical history, and using specific diagnostic tests. For both types 1 and 2, common tests include fasting blood sugar tests, random blood sugar tests, oral glucose tolerance tests, and glycated hemoglobin tests. \n",
      "\n",
      "The American Diabetes Association has updated its 2025 Standards of Care in Diabetes, introducing new recommendations for type 1 diabetes management. The updated guidelines for Type 1 Diabetes emphasize antibody-based screening for individuals with a family history or genetic risk (as up to 40 percent of cases remain undiagnosed), aiming for earlier detection of presymptomatic type 1 diabetes. Autoantibody blood tests can help identify presymptomatic Type 1 Diabetes, distinguishing it from Type 2. However, there is a need for clear guidance on monitoring at-risk patients and understanding disease progression in adults without a family history who test positive for autoantibodies. Additionally, for patients aged eight and older diagnosed with stage 2 type 1 diabetes, physicians are advised to discuss the potential use of Tzield (Teplizumab-mzwv), a monoclonal antibody approved to delay the onset of symptomatic disease. The guidelines also caution against the use of recreational cannabis in patients at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, due to its association with hyperemesis syndrome, which can lead to severe nausea and vomiting.\n",

      "Type 1 Diabetes: In this type of diabetes, the body's immune system attacks the pancreas's insulin-producing beta cells. This loss of insulin, essential for the cells to utilize glucose, impairs the body's ability to use glucose effectively. Therefore, glucose accumulates in the blood, and the blood sugar levels increase. \n",
      "Factors like environmental influences, genetic predisposition, or the presence of any infections can trigger the autoimmune reaction and lead to the development of type 1 diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "# articles/diabetes-health/differences-between-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes\n",
      "\n",
      "There are 3 stages in this diabetes:\n",
      "Stage 1: The individual shows no symptoms and has normal glucose levels but at least 2 pancreatic autoantibodies.\n",
      "Stage 2: The individual has many pancreatic autoantibodies and abnormal blood sugar levels. \n",
      "Stage 3: Sudden symptoms occur because of abnormal blood sugar levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Type 2 Diabetes: In this type of diabetes, the body initially increases insulin production to keep blood sugar levels stable. As the condition progresses, insulin secretion is not sufficient and cannot keep glucose levels stable; therefore, glucose remains in the blood itself. Over time, along with this insulin resistance and insufficient insulin production, blood sugar levels can not be maintained, leading to increased blood sugar levels. \n",

      "Treatment\n",
      "Because of the different causes, treatments for type 1 and type 2 diabetes differ. However, a healthy diet and regular exercise are important in both types.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Type 1 Diabetes: Management of type 1 diabetes mainly depends on insulin therapy, which can either be given daily or continuously with the help of insulin pumps. Regular monitoring of blood sugar levels is also important. For some cases, an islet cell or pancreas transplant may be a treatment option. \n",
      "Type 2 Diabetes: Medications are mainly used to help control the blood sugar levels. Medications such as Metformin, Glitazones, Sulfonylureas, Glinides, Gliptins, or Gliflozins are used. Other than medications, they should also focus on weight management, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and eating healthy. If blood sugar levels are not still under control after all this, insulin may be suggested. \n",

      "6.1 Insulin Therapy: Insulin therapy is a cornerstone of diabetes management, particularly for individuals with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes who require exogenous insulin to maintain glycemic control. There are various types of insulin available, each with distinct characteristics in terms of onset, peak action, and duration of effect. Additionally, insulin can be administered through different methods, including injections and insulin pumps.\n",
      "Types of Insulin\n",
      "Insulin is classified based on its pharmacokinetic properties, which determine its onset of action, peak effect, and duration of action. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for effective insulin therapy management.\n",
      "Rapid-Acting Insulin Analogs\n",
      "Examples: Insulin aspart (NovoRapid), insulin lispro (Humalog), insulin glulisine (Apidra)\n",
      "Onset: Begins to work within 4 to 20 minutes.\n",
      "Peak: Typically peaks in 1 to 2 hours.\n",
      "Duration: Lasts about 3 to 5 hours.\n",
      "Rapid-acting insulin analogs are designed to mimic the natural insulin response to food intake, providing a quick glucose-lowering effect. They are often used before meals to manage postprandial blood glucose excursions.\n",
      "Short-Acting Insulin\n",
      "Examples: Regular insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R).\n",
      "Onset: Takes about 15 to 30 minutes to start working.\n",
      "Peak: Peaks in 2 to 5 hours.\n",
      "Duration: Lasts approximately 6.5 to 8 hours.\n",
      "Short-acting insulin is also used around meal times but has a slightly longer duration than rapid-acting insulins, making it suitable for managing blood sugar levels when meals are consumed at regular intervals.\n",
      "Intermediate-Acting Insulin\n",
      "Examples: NPH (Humulin N, Novolin N).\n",
      "Onset: Starts working in 1 to 3 hours.\n",
      "Peak: Peaks in 4 to 12 hours.\n",
      "Duration: Lasts about 12 to 18 hours.\n",
      "Intermediate-acting insulin is often used to provide basal insulin coverage, particularly overnight or between meals. It helps maintain stable blood glucose levels during fasting periods.\n",
      "\n",
      "# articles/diabetes-health/types-of-insulin-for-diabetes-treatment\n",
      "Long-Acting Insulin Analogs\n",
      "Examples: Insulin glargine (Lantus, Basaglar), insulin detemir (Levemir)\n",
      "Onset: Begins to work in 1 to 1.5 hours.\n",
      "Peak: Minimal peak effect.\n",
      "Duration: Lasts approximately 16 to 24 hours.\n",
      "Long-acting insulin analogs are designed to provide a steady level of insulin throughout the day and night, helping to manage blood glucose levels without the peaks and troughs associated with shorter-acting insulins.\n",
      "Ultra Long-Acting Insulin Analogs\n",
      "Examples: Insulin degludec (Tresiba), insulin glargine U-300 (Toujeo)\n",
      "Onset: Begins to work in 1 to 1.5 hours.\n",
      "Peak: No distinct peak effect.\n",
      "Duration: Lasts approximately 30 to 42 hours.\n",
      "Ultra long-acting insulin analogs provide an even more stable and prolonged insulin effect compared to traditional long-acting insulins, allowing for less frequent dosing and improved glycemic control.\n",
      "Premixed Insulin\n",
      "Examples: Humulin 70/30, Novolog Mix 70/30.\n",
      "Composition: A combination of rapid- or short-acting and intermediate-acting insulins.\n",
      "Premixed insulins simplify the management of diabetes by combining two types of insulin in a single injection, making it easier for patients to administer their medications.\n",
      "Methods of Administration\n",
      "Insulin can be administered through various methods, each with its own advantages and considerations.\n",
      "Injections\n",
      "Syringes: Traditional method using a syringe to draw insulin from a vial. Requires careful measurement of doses.\n",
      "Insulin Pens: Pre-filled or refillable pens that allow for easier and more accurate dosing. They are portable and user-friendly, making them a popular choice.\n",
      "Jet Injectors: Devices that deliver insulin through the skin using a high-pressure jet, eliminating the need for needles.\n",
      "Insulin Pumps\n",
      "Insulin pumps are small, wearable devices that deliver a continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin through a catheter placed under the skin. They can be programmed to deliver basal rates and boluses for meals, allowing for greater flexibility and control over blood glucose levels.\n",
      "Advantages\n",
      "Improved glycemic control.\n",
      "Reduced risk of hypoglycemia, and the ability to adjust insulin delivery based on lifestyle changes.\n",

      "6.2 Blood Glucose Monitoring in Diabetes Management\n",
      "Blood glucose monitoring is the cornerstone of effective diabetes management. Monitoring glucose levels allows individuals to tailor lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy to maintain blood sugar within the target range. \n",
      "There are two primary methods of blood glucose monitoring:\n",
      "\n",
      "# articles/diabetes-health/continuous-glucose-monitoring-sensor\n",
      "Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM)\n",
      "CGM technology has transformed diabetes care by providing continuous, real-time data on glucose trends. These devices employ a small sensor inserted under the skin, usually on the abdomen or upper arm. The sensor measures interstitial glucose levels every few minutes, transmitting data to a receiver or smartphone app. CGM has gained prominence, particularly among individuals with Type 1 diabetes, where tight glucose control is essential.\n",
      "Mechanism of Action:\n",
      "The sensor in CGM measures the glucose concentration in the interstitial fluid, which lags behind blood glucose levels by approximately 10–15 minutes. This delay is significant when blood glucose levels change rapidly, such as after meals or exercise. A transmitter sends glucose readings to a display device, allowing users to monitor trends continuously. Some CGM systems, like the Dexcom G6 or Freestyle Libre, do not require regular finger-prick calibration, whereas earlier models did.\n",
      "Clinical Significance:\n",
      "CGM offers unique insights into glycemic variability, a predictor of diabetes-related complications. Studies show that continuous glucose monitoring leads to better glycemic control and reduces HbA1c levels in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes (Beck et al., 2017). Additionally, CGM data enables physicians to adjust insulin doses more accurately, reducing episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Benefits of CGM:\n",
      "Reduced Finger Pricks: One of the primary advantages of CGM is the reduction in the need for finger-stick testing. While traditional SMBG requires multiple daily fingerpricks, CGM sensors stay in place for several days, typically between 7 and 14 days, reducing discomfort.\n",
      "Improved Glycemic Control: CGM users benefit from real-time data on glucose levels, which helps detect postprandial spikes, nocturnal hypoglycemia, and general glucose trends. This enables personalized adjustments to insulin, diet, and activity, thereby improving overall glucose control. \n",
      "Detection of Hypoglycemia: Hypoglycemia, especially asymptomatic or nocturnal episodes, is a significant risk for individuals on insulin therapy. CGM systems can alert users to falling glucose levels, allowing early intervention. This feature is critical for preventing severe hypoglycemia, which can lead to seizures or unconsciousness.\n",
      "Time-in-Range (TIR): Another vital metric that CGM provides is the percentage of time glucose levels are within a target range. Higher TIR is associated with fewer complications, and CGM data can assist patients in maximizing this metric.\n",
      "Considerations for CGM:\n",
      "Cost: CGM systems are more expensive than traditional blood glucose meters. While many insurance plans in the UK cover CGM for individuals with Type 1 diabetes, access for people with Type 2 diabetes remains limited. Out-of-pocket costs can be prohibitive for some patients.\n",
      "Sensor Changes: CGM sensors need replacement every 7 to 14 days, depending on the model. This creates the need for regular sensor reapplication, which can be seen as inconvenient or uncomfortable by some users.\n",
      "Accuracy: While CGMs are generally reliable, certain factors can impact sensor accuracy. For instance, the delay in interstitial fluid readings compared to blood glucose can be problematic during periods of rapid glucose fluctuations. Furthermore, compression during sleep or certain medications may cause inaccurate readings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent Developments\n",
      "CGM technology continues to evolve, with next-generation systems offering greater accuracy, extended sensor wear times, and integration with insulin pumps. Automated insulin delivery systems (also called artificial pancreas systems) are an emerging technology that uses CGM data to modulate insulin delivery continuously, reducing the burden of diabetes management. \n",
      "Regular physical activity (PA) is also essential for managing type 1 diabetes, but it can cause blood sugar fluctuations, posing challenges for automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. This joint position statement by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) reviews current evidence on AID systems and offers clinical guidance for managing PA in children, adolescents, and adults with type 1 diabetes. It evaluates commercially available AID systems, discusses glucose responses to PA, and provides tailored therapy options to help maintain target glucose levels during exercise.\n",
      "# articles/no-article(NOT UPLOADED 1)\n",
      "Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG)\n",
      "SMBG has been a standard method of blood glucose monitoring for decades. Individuals use a lancet to obtain a small drop of blood, typically from the fingertip, which is then applied to a test strip and analyzed using a blood glucose meter.\n",
      "Mechanism of Action:\n",
      "SMBG devices measure glucose in whole blood, offering a direct snapshot of the current blood glucose level. These readings are highly accurate if conducted correctly, but they only reflect glucose levels at the moment of testing. The frequency of SMBG depends on the treatment regimen and individual needs. For example, individuals with Type 1 diabetes or those using intensive insulin regimens may need to test 4–10 times daily, whereas people with Type 2 diabetes not on insulin may test less frequently (American Diabetes Association, 2022).\n",
      "Clinical Significance:\n",
      "While SMBG provides critical information for day-to-day diabetes management, it offers a limited view compared to CGM. Nevertheless, SMBG is essential for many individuals, especially for those who cannot afford CGM or those in resource-limited settings. When performed correctly, SMBG can be effective in improving glycemic control, especially when paired with education on interpreting the results.\n",
      "Benefits of SMBG:\n",
      "Affordability: SMBG devices are more affordable than CGMs and are covered by most healthcare systems and insurance plans. The wide availability of these devices means that people with diabetes can access reliable blood glucose data without significant cost barriers.\n",
      "Simplicity: SMBG is simple to learn, making it accessible to most individuals with diabetes. Modern meters are compact, portable, and provide results within seconds, allowing for convenient, on-the-go testing.\n",
      "Accuracy: When performed correctly, SMBG provides highly accurate blood glucose measurements. However, accuracy is dependent on proper technique, such as using the right test strips, proper calibration, and obtaining an adequate blood sample.\n",
      "Considerations for SMBG:\n",
      "Pain and Discomfort: Repeated finger pricks can cause discomfort, especially in individuals who need frequent testing. Over time, finger calluses and soreness can develop, making daily testing burdensome.\n",
      "Limited Data: SMBG provides a single reading at a point in time, offering no information on glucose trends or overnight changes. As a result, individuals may miss periods of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia without frequent testing, which can impact long-term glycemic control.\n",
      "Adherence: Patient adherence to SMBG protocols is often a challenge. The inconvenience of frequent testing may lead to skipped checks, which reduces the effectiveness of diabetes management.\n",
      "Both CGM and SMBG play crucial roles in diabetes management, offering different benefits and challenges. The choice between CGM and SMBG depends on factors such as cost, convenience, and individual medical needs. CGM provides a continuous stream of data that allows for real-time adjustments, ideal for those requiring intensive insulin management, while SMBG remains an accessible, accurate, and cost-effective method for glucose monitoring.\n",

      "6.3 Lifestyle Modifications\n",
      "For individuals with Type 1 diabetes, lifestyle modifications, including diet, nutrition, and physical activity, play a crucial role in managing blood sugar levels, reducing complications, and maintaining overall health. \n",
      "Here's a detailed guide on the key areas:\n",
      "Diet and Nutrition Recommendations\n",
      "Proper nutrition helps manage blood glucose levels and reduce the risk of complications associated with diabetes, such as heart disease or nerve damage.\n",
      "Carbohydrate Counting: Since carbohydrates affect blood glucose the most, learning to count carbs is essential. This helps in adjusting insulin doses based on the carbohydrate content of the meal. \n",
      "Carbs can be classified into:\n",
      "Simple carbs (sugars) such as sweets, sugary beverages, and pastries.\n",
      "Complex carbs such as whole grains, legumes, and vegetables.\n",
      "Glycemic Index (GI): Choose foods with a lower GI as they release glucose slowly into the bloodstream. Low-GI foods include whole grains, legumes, most fruits, and non-starchy vegetables.\n",
      "Balanced Diet:\n",
      "Fruits and Vegetables: Rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. They help maintain blood sugar levels and improve overall health.\n",
      "Protein: Include lean protein sources like fish, poultry, tofu, beans, and low-fat dairy. Protein has minimal impact on blood sugar.\n",
      "Healthy Fats: Focus on unsaturated fats like olive oil, nuts, seeds, and avocados while limiting saturated and trans fats.\n",
      "Meal Timing and Frequency: Consistency in meal timing can help stabilize blood sugar. It's important to avoid skipping meals and to monitor portion sizes.\n",
      "Hydration: Drink water regularly. Sugary drinks like sodas and juices should be limited as they can cause rapid blood sugar spikes.\n",
      "Snacks: Choose low-carb snacks like nuts, seeds, Greek yogurt, and vegetables to prevent blood sugar dips between meals.\n",
      "Exercise and Physical Activity Guidelines\n",
      "Exercise is crucial for improving insulin sensitivity, lowering blood glucose levels, and maintaining cardiovascular health. However, physical activity can have varying effects on blood sugar, so careful planning is necessary.\n",
      "Types of Exercise:\n",
      "Aerobic Exercise: Activities like walking, swimming, cycling, or running improve heart health and increase insulin sensitivity. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week.\n",
      "Strength Training: Weightlifting or resistance exercises build muscle, which helps in managing blood sugar. Try to include strength training at least twice a week.\n",
      "Flexibility and Balance Exercises: Yoga or stretching can improve mobility, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being.\n",
      "Before Exercise:\n",
      "Check Blood Sugar: Ensure that blood sugar levels are within a safe range (typically 100–250 mg/dL). If blood sugar is too low or too high, adjustments may be needed before starting physical activity.\n",
      "Adjust Insulin Doses: Consult a healthcare provider to adjust insulin before physical activity. Insulin doses may need to be reduced to avoid hypoglycemia during or after exercise.\n",
      "Carbohydrate Snacks: Have fast-acting carbs like glucose tablets or fruit juice available in case of low blood sugar during exercise.\n",
      "After Exercise:\n",
      "Monitor blood sugar after activity, as exercise can lower blood glucose for up to 24 hours. Post-exercise meals should include carbs and proteins to replenish energy and prevent delayed hypoglycemia.\n",
      "Key Tips:\n",
      "Consistency: Regular physical activity and a balanced diet are more effective than irregular, high-intensity sessions or crash diets.\n",
      "Monitor Blood Sugar: Frequent monitoring of blood sugar levels is essential to understand how different foods and exercises affect your body.\n",
      "Consult Healthcare Providers: Regular consultations with dietitians, endocrinologists, and diabetes educators can provide personalized advice on insulin, diet, and exercise modifications.\n",

      "People with type 1 diabetes, especially adolescents and young adults, are known to have compromised mental well-being. The main reason for the cause of psychological illnesses in such individuals is the frustration that they could do nothing about the disease and the realization that there is no absolute cure for type 1 diabetes. There is also a constant need to manage the condition and adhere to strict regimens to prevent any sort of complications. So, type 1 diabetic patients experience various mental health issues like stress, anxiety, depression, diabetic distress, and burnout. People also tend to develop eating disorders like diabulimia.\n",

      "Diabulimia is a dangerous and life-threatening eating disorder where people with type 1 diabetes tend to take reduced insulin or omit insulin intake completely with the objective of losing weight. This is sometimes accompanied by bulimic behavior. The main cause of diabulimia is weight gain that occurs after insulin intake. \n",
      "\n",
      "People with type 1 diabetes tend to take the weight gain very seriously and try to avoid insulin intake for losing the gained weight. But this in turn causes serious complications like hyperglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and organ failure. Thus, patients with diabulimia require both medical and psychological management to deal with associated body issues and depression. \n",

A study examined the link between anxiety, depression, self-efficacy, social support, and self-care management in Jordanian adolescents (ages 14–18) with type 1 diabetes. It found that most participants had high anxiety and depression, poor self-efficacy, moderate social support, and low self-care management. Self-efficacy and social support were positively linked to better self-care, with social support playing a mediating role. However, anxiety and depression did not directly affect self-care. The study highlights the need for routine mental health screening and educational programs to improve self-care practices in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.\n",

      "Common ways through which mental health support is provided are:\n",
      "Counseling and Associated Therapy - During every medical follow-up visit, psychiatrists may provide counseling and identify the areas of stress in individuals with type 1 diabetes. This can help in providing the necessary therapy for better mental stability. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is suggested for people who have negative thoughts and feel extremely low due to the disease and the symptoms. A brief CBT is also advised in advanced cases where people find it really difficult and struggle to cope up with the manifestations of the disease and take an untoward course. Talk therapy and other counseling methods are used to deal with symptoms of depression and anxiety.\n",
      "Support Groups - Specialized hospitals have support groups that provide a space for type 1 diabetic individuals to put their feelings forward and share their experiences in their journey in coping with the disease. Such groups offer valuable peer support, as individuals living with type 1 diabetes will provide more meaningful advice and understanding than outsiders. Their firsthand experience with the condition allows them to offer practical insights, empathy, and guidance that resonate more deeply with those facing similar challenges. This creates an emotional bond for ailing individuals to open up and get help for their challenges. \n",
      "Professional Psychiatric Care - When the symptoms of anxiety and depression cannot be combated with just counseling and support groups, professional psychiatric ongoing care may be required. This is particularly required for individuals with severe psychiatric manifestations like diabulimia and severe depression. Along with therapy, such individuals require medications like antidepressants to cope with the mental health toll. \n",
      "\n",
      "With such psychiatric support, you can always manage the disease and maintain your mental stability. Such emotional breakdowns can be prevented by educating yourself about the disease. Gaining enough knowledge and understanding about the disease can put you in a position to remain optimistic throughout life while dealing with physical manifestations of the disorder. There are several education programs that can help you to equip yourself with all the necessary information about the disorder, its progression, and strategies to handle the disorder.\n",

      "Beta-Cell Regeneration\n",
      "A key area of diabetes research is the regeneration of insulin-producing beta cells, which are destroyed in Type 1 diabetes and impaired in Type 2 diabetes. Scientists are investigating how to stimulate the body to regenerate or replace these beta cells using stem cell therapy or drugs that encourage beta-cell growth.\n",
      "Stem Cell Therapies: These involve using stem cells to create new, functioning beta cells, which can then be transplanted into patients. Researchers are working on two main approaches:\n",
      "Pluripotent Stem Cells (PSCs): These are stem cells that can differentiate into any cell type, including beta cells. By guiding PSCs to develop into functional beta cells, scientists hope to provide a source of cells that can be transplanted into patients with Type 1 or advanced Type 2 diabetes.\n",
      "Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs): These are adult cells reprogrammed to a pluripotent state, meaning they can potentially turn into beta cells. This technique is promising because iPSCs can be derived from a patient's own cells, reducing the risk of immune rejection after transplantation.\n",
      "Small Molecule Therapies: Some studies are exploring the use of small molecules that can trigger the regeneration of beta cells in the pancreas. By targeting key signaling pathways involved in cell growth and survival, small molecules aim to reawaken the body's dormant capacity for beta-cell regeneration, potentially reversing or slowing diabetes progression.\n",

Immunotherapy aims to modulate the body’s immune system to prevent the autoimmune destruction of these beta cells. Early-stage clinical trials are underway to determine whether specific therapies can halt or slow down the immune attack that destroys these critical cells. Immunotherapeutic advances include antigen-independent (e.g., antibody-based and cytokine inhibitors), antigen-dependent (e.g., autoantigen vaccines), beta cell, and stem cell therapies. \n",
      "Emerging strategies like CAR-Tregs and JAK-STAT inhibition show promise for immune modulation and beta cell regeneration. Ongoing research aims to refine personalized treatments and move toward a potential cure for T1D. Among the advances observed in immunotherapy, engineered immune cells are made to modulate the immune system. These engineered cells aim to enhance the body's ability to combat autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes (T1D). By reprogramming immune cells, researchers hope to create treatments that can more effectively target and manage autoimmune conditions, potentially leading to improved outcomes for individuals with T1D.\n",
      "T-Cell Modulation: Therapies focus on re-educating or suppressing the immune cells responsible for attacking beta cells. \n",
      "Key approaches in this area include:\n",
      "Suppressing or re-educating T-cells: The goal is to either suppress the activity of autoreactive T-cells or reprogram them to ignore beta cells. This may involve targeting specific molecules or receptors on the surface of T-cells to alter their behavior.\n",
      "Regulatory T-cells (Tregs): Some therapies aim to increase the number or functionality of regulatory T-cells, which naturally help control immune responses and prevent autoimmunity. Boosting Tregs could help restore balance in the immune system, preventing the attack on beta cells.\n",
      "Vaccine Development: Some researchers are working on vaccines to prevent the onset of Type 1 diabetes by targeting the autoimmune process. \n",
      "There are two main strategies in vaccine research:\n",
      "Preventative Vaccines: These are designed to stop the immune system from initiating an attack on beta cells in individuals at high risk for Type 1 diabetes (such as those with a family history of the disease). These vaccines target specific antigens or proteins associated with the immune response to beta cells.\n",
      "Therapeutic Vaccines: These vaccines aim to halt the progression of Type 1 diabetes in people who have already developed the disease but still have some residual beta-cell function. The goal is to prevent further immune destruction of beta cells, preserving the body's ability to produce insulin.\n",
      "Gene Editing for Insulin Production: There are also efforts to use gene therapy to directly modify cells in the liver or other tissues to produce insulin. This would create a system where the body has an alternate method of producing insulin, bypassing the need for beta cells entirely.\n",

In fact, adult-onset type 1 diabetes is now becoming increasingly common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Type 1 Diabetes Occurs Due to Excessive Sugar Consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Sugar consumption has nothing to do with the incidence of type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that occurs when antibodies in the body recognize the beta cells in the pancreas as foreign cells and try to destroy them through autoantibody production. In individuals with type 1 diabetes, the sugar intake should be controlled to maintain optimal glycemic levels in the blood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Type 1 Diabetes is Contagious and Can Spread from One Person to Another.\n",
      "\n",

      "Myth: Type 1 Diabetes Can Be Completely Cured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Type 1 diabetes is a condition that cannot be completely cured. Once diagnosed, the progression of the disease can be prevented and managed through various strategies but complete resolution of the disease is not possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Exercise Can Cure or Prevent Type 1 Diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Exercise is an important part of the management process of type 1 diabetes. It helps you to improve the insulin sensitivity, control blood sugar levels, and remain active. However, it cannot cure or prevent the disease. Additionally, exercise does not eliminate the need to take insulin medications in type 1 diabetes. \n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Type 1 Diabetes is Reversible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Type 1 diabetes is not a reversible condition as there is progressive loss of beta cells and pancreatic structure due to ongoing autoimmune activity happening in the body throughout the life. Several management strategies only aim to maintain optimal insulin levels while preventing the progression of the disease. \n",

      "Myth: Stress Has no Impact on the Sugar Levels in Type 1 Diabetes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Stress is a major risk factor for increasing blood sugar levels in type 1 diabetes. This is because stress activates the release of cortisol and adrenaline in the blood. This in turn causes an increase in the glucose production in the liver and makes insulin less effective in the body. So, stress should be managed through counseling or other mental health support options.\n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: All People with Type 1 Diabetes Must Use Insulin Pumps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: The use of insulin pumps for delivery of insulin is completely dependent on one's choice. Insulin can be administered to the body through injections or through insulin pumps. Insulin injections should be taken multiple times to maintain a homogenous level of insulin in the body. Insulin pumps can provide continuous insulin delivery to the body.

An immune system strong enough to encounter infectious attacks can be maintained with proper management of the condition. \n",
      "\n",
      "Myth: Insulin Should be Administered When a Person with Type 1 Diabetes Has Hypoglycemia to Stabilize the Blood Sugar Levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fact: Insulin should never be administered if a person with type 1 diabetes is already hypoglycemic. This is because it can further reduce the blood sugar levels and result in a coma state. The primary management in an emergency hypoglycemic condition is to administer fast acting carbohydrates like glucose. Once blood sugar has stabilized, regular insulin administration can resume as needed. \n",

      "Severe Hypos and No Insulin: The Puzzle of Uncontrollable Blood Sugar Drops: A worried wife consulted our iCliniq doctor, concerned about her husband's type 1 diabetes. Despite not taking fast-acting Insulin that day, he experienced five severe hypos, with his blood sugar repeatedly dropping despite drinking juice and soda to stabilize it. She was puzzled and scared, noting that he had not done anything different. The doctor responded, asking for more information, and she explained that her husband had been diabetic for five years and was usually able to manage his symptoms like shaking, sweating, and a racing heart. But that day felt off. The doctor suggested checking kidney function, thyroid, and cortisol levels, mentioning the possibility of neuropathy. Fear mixes with hope as she vows to get him tested, relieved to finally have direction in the search for answers.\n",
      "Eyes on Alert: How a Flash of Light Led to a Diabetic Retinopathy Scare: A 27-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes wrote to our iCliniq doctor, worried about vision changes, including floaters and a possible flash of light while driving. She had scheduled an eye exam but asked if waiting two and a half weeks was too long. The doctor advised her to get checked sooner, as diabetic retinopathy could develop early. Reassured, she booked an earlier appointment, confident she was taking the right steps to protect her vision.\n",
      "Finding Strength: A Woman's Fight to Manage Diabetes Through Insulin and Exercise: A woman with type 1 diabetes wrote to our iCliniq doctor, struggling with high HbA1c, insulin bumps, and painful injections. She also experienced frequent morning hypoglycemia, causing overeating and blood sugar spikes. Concerned about her insulin and Metformin dosages, she sought advice on how to adjust them and manage her blood sugar more effectively. Planning to start exercising, she asked how the gym could help. The doctor advised her to rotate injection sites, adjust her insulin dosage with a local doctor's help, monitor glucose levels, and use exercise to improve insulin sensitivity. Encouraged, she felt ready to take control of her diabetes.\n",
      "Faith and Fasting: A Diabetic Teen's Journey to Safe Observance: An 18-year-old with type 1 diabetes approached our iCliniq doctor, asking if she could fast for religious reasons while taking Mixtard insulin—14 units in the morning and 6 in the evening. The doctor advised against fasting for those with type 1 diabetes but suggested that if her blood sugar is well-controlled, she could try fasting by reversing her insulin doses. The doctor emphasized the importance of breaking the fast if her sugar levels drop below 70 mg/dL or rise above 300 mg/dL and to avoid vigorous exercise. Reassured, she felt better prepared to manage her fast safely.\n",
      "Type 1 Diabetes and Parenthood: A Couple's Story of Hope and Preparedness: A concerned man wrote to our doctor, explaining that both he and his wife have type 1 diabetes. His wife, five months pregnant, was diagnosed just last year, and he worried about the risk of their baby developing diabetes.

      "A Single Episode or Something More? Understanding GI Issues with Type 1 Diabetes: If you have type 1 diabetes and suddenly experience nausea and diarrhea with a lime green tint, you might worry about diabetic enteropathy. This was the case for a 27-year-old who reached out with similar concerns. Despite a recent A1C of 6.8 and fluctuating blood sugar levels, he feared this could signal a serious issue. Fortunately, diabetic enteropathy is usually a chronic condition, not something diagnosed from a single episode of diarrhea, which is more commonly caused by infections, food poisoning, or medication reactions. The absence of blood in the stool, fever, or severe pain generally indicates it's not serious. Improving blood sugar control and possibly using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can aid in better managing diabetes and preventing such issues. Adopting a balanced diet and appropriate insulin management is crucial. If you're unsure or worried about your symptoms, consulting with your healthcare provider is always advisable.\n",
      "Two Types of Diabetes and One Child: From Daily Meds to Pancreatic Transplants: For an 11-year-old who has battled both type 1 and type 2 diabetes from birth, the journey can be particularly challenging. Initially on insulin injections and now taking daily tablets, the child's pancreas has never functioned properly. Parents wondering about permanent treatments might consider options like pancreatic transplants. These procedures are available at certain hospitals but can be costly and require lifelong immunosuppressive medications. While this may seem daunting, managing diabetes with medication remains a practical alternative. Exploring all treatment options with healthcare professionals can help in making the best choice for the child's needs.\n",
      "Family History and Fear: One Mom's Search for Answers to Protect Her Son: A worried mom of a 12-year-old, noticing her son always thirsty, hungry, and gaining weight, grew concerned due to her family's history of diabetes—his grandfather had type 1, and his father had type 2. Fearing for his health, she consulted a doctor to understand Jake's risk of developing diabetes and how to prevent it. The doctor explained that while the son's genetics increased his chances, type 1 diabetes couldn't be prevented but could be managed with early detection. Essential tests like blood glucose and HbA1c would help assess his condition, and adopting a healthy lifestyle could significantly lower his risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The doctor emphasized a balanced diet, regular exercise, and weight control, along with routine check-ups. Reassured by this guidance, the mom felt better prepared to support her son in making healthier choices for his future well-being.\n",

Knowing diabetes could affect his cardiovascular system, he sought advice from our iCliniq doctor. He asked about the risks and how best to protect his heart while managing diabetes. The doctor explained that diabetes increases the risk of heart disease by damaging blood vessels and nerves. Early warning signs to watch for include chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. To protect his heart, he was advised to focus on a heart-healthy diet, regular exercise, and managing blood sugar levels. He was also encouraged to request tests like an ECG, echocardiogram, and lipid profile to monitor his heart health. Reassured, the patient felt better equipped to safeguard his heart while continuing to manage his diabetes effectively.\n",
      "Helping My Husband with Type 1 Diabetes Eat Healthier: The wife was concerned about her husband's frequent consumption of ultra-processed foods, knowing it could harm his blood sugar and health. Seeking advice from a doctor, she learned that these foods cause rapid blood sugar spikes due to their high sugar and refined carb content, complicating diabetes management. Over time, they could lead to obesity and heart problems. The doctor suggested avoiding sugary drinks, packaged snacks, and fast food and replacing them with whole grains, lean proteins, and vegetables. To help her husband's transition, she planned small changes, like swapping one processed meal for a healthier option and focusing on fiber-rich foods for better blood sugar control. With gradual adjustments, she felt confident in supporting her husband's journey toward a healthier diet.\n",
      "Navigating Type 1 Diabetes with CGMs and Insulin Technology: A 35-Year-Old's Journey: At 35, a male user was newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and felt unsure about managing his condition, especially diet and exercise. Our iCliniq doctor advised him to focus on eating non-starchy vegetables like leafy greens, whole grains such as brown rice, lean proteins like fish and chicken, and healthy fats from nuts and olive oil. Avoiding sugary and processed foods was key to keeping his blood sugar stable. Carb counting became an important part of his routine, with apps to help track his intake. Exercise was beneficial for improving insulin sensitivity, but he had to monitor his blood sugar closely before and after workouts to avoid drops. The doctor recommended checking his glucose levels several times daily using a glucose meter or continuous glucose monitor (CGM). For insulin management, the patient was encouraged to try Insulin pens or pumps for convenience and to watch for complications like heart disease or neuropathy. With these strategies, he felt more in control of his diabetes.\n",
      "Essential Insights on Managing Type 1 Diabetes in Adolescents: The iCliniq user was deeply concerned about their 12-year-old niece who had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune condition requiring lifelong insulin therapy through injections or a pump to manage blood sugar levels. They sought advice on managing the insulin on, including diet, lifestyle, and its impact on her development. Our doctor advised regular blood glucose monitoring, a balanced diet with appropriate carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and regular physical activity. Emotional support from family was also crucial.

      "Understanding Insulin Patches: Benefits and Risks for Kids: The iCliniq user sought advice about his 10-year-old daughter with type 1 diabetes, showing symptoms like increased thirst, frequent urination, and weight loss, with consistently high blood sugar levels despite insulin injections. Concerned about her long-term health, he considered using insulin patches to stabilize her blood sugar. Insulin patches are a newer delivery method that provides continuous rapid-acting insulin infusion through a small cannula under the skin, similar to an insulin pump. They last a few days before replacement and can be used with continuous glucose monitors for real-time monitoring and improved insulin adjustment. For kids and teens, insulin patches can reduce daily injections, maintain stable glucose levels, lower HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) levels, and benefit active children who are finding injections challenging. However, skin irritation, allergic reactions, cannula issues, and hypoglycemia are risks. Discussions with endocrinologists, regular blood sugar monitoring, insulin regimen adjustments, balanced diet, activity, and doctor follow-ups are crucial for managing diabetes effectively.\n",
      "Balancing Work and Diabetes: A 35-year-old man approached our iCliniq doctor, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, leading to concerns about his job as a truck driver and his two-year-old son's health. He felt overwhelmed by the new responsibilities of carbohydrate counting, insulin doses, and blood sugar targets. He questioned how long it would take for him to adjust to this new reality. Our doctor advised him to gradually learn about managing diabetes, inform employers about the condition, check blood sugar levels regularly, and educate family members on how to provide support. Testing the son for diabetes may not be necessary. Establishing daily routines for meals, insulin, and monitoring is crucial. Seeking guidance from a diabetes educator or support group is recommended for personalized advice. Over time, managing diabetes will become more familiar, and incorporating lifestyle practices like yoga, regular exercise, and a balanced diet can support overall well-being.\n",
      "Practical Advice for Type 1 Diabetics Facing Weight Issues: A type 1 diabetic patient who had gained weight during quarantine despite having a normal BMI (body mass index) approached our iCliniq doctors. This weight gain was noticeable in his belly, arms, and legs.  After three weeks of minimal resistance training and diet changes, his legs appeared leaner, but his upper body remained unchanged. He was concerned about the relationship between his insulin medication and weight gain, unable to seek help from a dietician due to quarantine restrictions. Seeking assistance online, he aimed to improve his overall health for life. Insulin may contribute to weight gain, but consuming non-starchy foods like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables can help reduce fat. Regular aerobic exercise such as walking and cycling can strengthen muscles. It was vital to maintain blood sugar levels and not reduce insulin dosage, avoid skipping meals to prevent overeating, and opt for protein- and fiber-rich foods for early satiety.\n",
      "Balancing Diet and Insulin: A Guide for Diabetic Patients: The patient with type 1 diabetes consulted iCliniq doctors after not gaining weight for five years due to sugar deprivation from insulin shots. The doctor recommended a diet consisting of three meals daily with starchy complex carbs like wheat, bread, and pasta, paired with lean meats such as chicken or fish. In between meals, consumption of low-fat options like butter, skimmed milk, or curd was advised, along with a variety of fruits like apples and grapes daily. Adding green leafy vegetables and snacks like chicken soup to the diet was also recommended. Insulin doses should be adjusted based on blood sugar levels after following these guidelines for a month.\n",
      "Balancing Life and Diabetes: Insights for Young Patients: A 15-year-old with type 1 diabetes sought guidance from iCliniq doctors and faced challenges, such as difficulty enjoying snacks and finger pricks, feeling isolated at school, and worrying about managing their condition long-term. The fear of hypoglycemic episodes during soccer practice and dating was a significant concern due to frequent insulin injections. Seeking guidance on how other teens handle these obstacles, the teenager wanted to navigate their situation better. Despite the challenges, our doctor said that many teens successfully manage diabetes by educating themselves, monitoring blood sugar, and having quick sugar sources for activities like soccer. Also, choosing diabetes-friendly snacks, working with a dietitian for balanced meals, explaining the condition to friends and teachers, and joining support groups were recommended. Our doctor advised being open about diabetes while dating, staying active, and practicing self-compassion. Establishing a routine, setting achievable goals, celebrating successes, finding role models for motivation, and utilizing resources like JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) and diabetes camps to connect with peers were also advised.\n",
      "Managing Diabetes During Pregnancy: Key Insights for Expecting Mothers: A 28-week pregnant woman with type 1 diabetes approached our iCliniq doctors.

She was worried about potential harm to her baby and sought advice on maintaining stable blood sugars amid rapid changes. She was concerned about birth defects, baby size, and labor complications due to diabetes. Our doctors advised frequent blood sugar monitoring, insulin adjustments, small balanced meals, healthy snacks by the bed, and regular prenatal check-ups for optimal blood sugar control. Also advised that working with healthcare providers on a delivery plan was essential, ensuring close monitoring of blood sugar during labor. Additionally, sharing concerns with loved ones and prioritizing rest and sleep can support a healthy pregnancy and baby.\n",
      "Optimizing Health for Conception with Type 1 Diabetes: A 24-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes seeking pregnancy advice from iCliniq doctors was advised to aim for a weight of 115-125 pounds to reduce insulin needs.

Our doctors suggested taking five milligrams of folic acid daily a month before conception to help prevent birth defects and miscarriages. Additionally, keeping HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) levels below 6.5 percent for three months prior to pregnancy and ensuring normal blood counts were essential to rule out anemia.\n",
      "Understanding the Health Implications of Marrying a Diabetic Partner: The iCliniq user inquired about the potential outcomes of a marriage between a girl without diabetes and a boy with type 1 diabetes on the health of their children. While there was an eight percent theoretical chance of the child inheriting diabetes, advancements in diabetes management have made it easier to control the condition. The couple's compatibility and commitment to health played a significant role in ensuring a happy and fulfilling life, as long as the boy and his family prioritize their health.\n",
