A Relatable Story Of Someone Struggling With Obesity


Kyle Harris, an Obesity Action Coalition Community (OAC) member living in Texas, struggled with weight for years. Watching the scale climb past 300 pounds and then 400 pounds, he found himself facing obesity-related conditions such as sleep apnea, high blood pressure, and type 2 diabetes. Simple tasks became daunting challenges - bending over to tie shoes left him dizzy and out of breath, walking a mere 100 feet was exhausting, and outdoor activities became out of reach due to rapid overheating. Playing with his granddaughter, a simple joy for many, felt like an unattainable dream. Sadly, Harris's story mirrors that of millions across the globe, where obesity rates have skyrocketed in recent years. About a 23 percent increase in obesity rates over the past decade alone is observed. As of the most recent data released by the World Health Organization (WHO), about a whopping 1.9 billion adults worldwide tip the scales into the overweight category, with over 650 million falling into the obese category. Moreover, the eye-opening thing is low and middle-income countries are now taking center stage in experiencing a rapid uptick in obesity. But fear not as a flavorful journey through nutritious cuisine, active living, cultural wellness practices, and weight loss drugs empowers Harris and others with higher BMI to embrace a healthier, happier lifestyle rooted in tradition and vitality.

Living with obesity was a struggle that went beyond physical discomfort; it seeped into every aspect of life, from self-esteem to social interactions. Being constantly bullied and feeling judged by society led to a deep-seated hatred for oneself. It was a dark and depressing journey, marked by mental stress and sadness akin to those dealing with chronic illnesses like diabetes.

For individuals with obesity, every social event or family gathering became a battleground of temptation and restraint. Food, often the centerpiece of such occasions, required careful planning to navigate. Yet, despite their efforts, they faced teasing, staring and missed personal and professional opportunities.

The alarming rise in obesity rates worldwide paints a grim picture of a global health crisis. In the United States alone, over 40 percent of adults and 19 percent of children are affected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These numbers, however, are more than just statistics—they profoundly impact individuals' health and well-being.

The prevalence of obesity has surged over the years. In 2022, one out of every eight individuals worldwide grappled with obesity, with rates doubling among adults since 1990 and quadrupling among adolescents. Over 2.5 billion adults were classified as overweight, with 890 million suffering from obesity. Among children, 37 million under the age of five and over 390 million aged 5 to 19 were overweight, with 160 million facing obesity.

Obesity poses a significant health risk, potentially leading to a myriad of diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and various cancers. It's estimated that up to 90 percent of individuals with type 2 diabetes are also overweight or obese, demonstrating a clear link between obesity and diabetes. Moreover, obesity significantly increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of death worldwide, and elevates the risk for certain types of cancer, including breast, colon, and kidney cancer.

Addressing obesity is not merely about achieving a slimmer figure; it's about enhancing overall health and potentially extending life expectancy. It necessitates adopting healthier eating patterns, increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behaviors, and ensuring adequate sleep. Through such measures, it's possible to diminish the prevalence of obesity and its associated health complications, paving the way for a healthier and more vibrant future for all.


## Article: Obesity - Causes, Symptoms, Risks, and Myths

Obesity is defined as excessive fat accumulation that may impact health. Obesity is a significant concern due to its connection to worsened mental health and diminished quality of life. Both in the United States and globally, obesity is linked to major causes of mortality, such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and certain forms of cancer. Obesity can lead to various problems, such as diabetes, heart disease, bone diseases, and chronic health diseases. It also affects the quality of life. The body mass index determines obesity. Body mass index refers to medical screening tools that measure the ratio of height to weight. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines obesity as follows:
For Adults - If BMI is greater or equal to 30.
For Children under the age of 5 years - Obesity is defined as having a weight-for-height that exceeds three standard deviations beyond the median established by the WHO Child Growth Standards.

Types Of Obesity - 
Obesity and being overweight are two different health concerns. Obesity is a complex chronic disease that may impair health, whereas being overweight is excessive body weight due to fat accumulation. If the body mass index (BMI) falls within the range of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m², then the person is classified as overweight.

Healthcare professionals classify obesity into three types:
Class 1 Obesity - BMI between 30 and less than 35 kg/m2.
Class 2 Obesity - BMI is between 35 and less than 40 kg/m2.
Class 3 Obesity - BMI is more than 40 kg/m2.

Consequences Of Obesity
The following are the consequences of obesity:
Elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
Type 2 diabetes.
Respiratory difficulties such as asthma and sleep apnea.
Joint ailments like osteoarthritis and discomfort in the musculoskeletal system.
Children face anxiety and depression. 
Children have decreased self-esteem and reduced self-perception of life quality. 
Children also face bullying and stigmatization. 
Obesity also affects the economy. In 2019, the United States incurred approximately medical expenses associated with obesity, nearly $173 billion. Furthermore, annual productivity costs nationwide due to obesity-related absenteeism ranged from $3.38 billion (equating to $79 per individual with obesity) to $6.38 billion ($132 per individual with obesity). The preventive, diagnostic, and treatment services cost medically. Indirect costs pertain to the impact on productivity due to illness and mortality. Productivity measures encompass absenteeism from work due to obesity-related health issues, reduced efficiency while at work, and premature death and disability.
Obesity impairs military readiness. 

Weight loss drugs are pharmaceutical medications designed to assist individuals in losing weight by targeting various mechanisms involved in regulating appetite, metabolism, or fat absorption. These drugs can complement lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise to help people achieve their weight loss goals. Studies have shown that weight loss drugs can also prevent chronic diseases or consequences of obesity in obese people. A few weight loss drugs, such as Orlistat, help reduce at least 5 percent of body weight in one year. Combating obesity through weight loss drugs can reduce appetite, making it easier for individuals to consume fewer calories. Secondly, weight loss drugs can enhance metabolism, increasing the body's ability to burn calories and fat. This can lead to more efficient weight loss, especially with regular physical activity. Moreover, some weight loss drugs block fat absorption in the digestive system, reducing the number of calories absorbed from food. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals who struggle to maintain a low-fat diet.

This article aims to shed light on the prevalent issues of obesity, weight loss, being overweight, and the consequences of obesity. Additionally, we will discuss the role of weight loss drugs in addressing obesity, examining their types, effectiveness, and safety. Long-term use of weight loss drugs raises questions regarding their efficacy and potential drawbacks. Monitoring for adverse effects, managing tolerance and dependence, and addressing lifestyle factors are essential aspects of prolonged treatment with these medications. Looking ahead, the future of weight loss drugs holds promise, with ongoing research and development initiatives discussed in this article.

Section 1 - Understanding Obesity
## Article: Obesity - Causes, Symptoms, Risks, and Myths

What Is Obesity?
Obesity is a chronic, complex condition characterized by excessive fat deposits, which may adversely affect health. Obesity has an impact on everyday activities, including sleeping and moving. Obesity is beyond a cosmetic problem. It is a medical condition that raises the risk of several other illnesses and health issues. These may include heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, liver disease, and sleep apnea. It can also impact the health of bones and fertility, and it raises the risk of developing several cancers. The standard measure of obesity in adults is a BMI of 27 to 30 or greater. Severe or morbid obesity is defined as having a BMI of 40 or above. Growth charts are used to measure childhood obesity.

Causes of Obesity
Understanding the underlying causes of obesity may help with treatment. Consult with a healthcare practitioner about one's daily routines, medical history, and family medical history to determine the most suitable approach.

Psychological Factors
Obesity has been linked with an increased risk of depression and anxiety. Individuals with obesity may experience social stigma and discrimination, which can exacerbate their mental health problems.

Energy In - Energy Out
Weight gain may result from an imbalance between calories consumed and burnt.  
Long drives and desk jobs make it difficult to obtain enough physical activity.  
Not all localities provide safe places to run, ride, or walk.  
Short sessions of intense exercise throughout the day can be helpful.

Sleep Deprivation
Research indicates a connection between sleep duration and body weight.
Lack of sleep generally causes people to weigh heavier than those who get enough sleep.

Appetite Signals or Hormones
Hormones are molecules found in the body that regulate the function and activity of tissues and organs, including the ability to sense hunger or fullness.
The hormones that indicate hunger and fullness may not always function properly in obese people.

Genetic Factors
Genes in the body can determine obesity risk.
It is still possible to lose weight while having these genes. Even a 5 percent reduction in weight can have a positive impact on general health.

Prescription Medications
Prescription drugs may result in gradual weight gain of several pounds.
Do not discontinue taking medications that are causing weight gain, instead, consult the healthcare practitioner about alternate drug options.

Environmental Factors
These include television commercials, billboards, and images that encourage the consumption of high-calorie and fat-rich foods and beverages.
Some communities lack access to grocery stores for fresh and affordable vegetables, forcing residents to rely on processed and unhealthy diets.

Symptoms of Obesity
Common signs and symptoms of obesity include -
Increased Body Weight - Obesity is characterized by excessive weight gain, usually measured by a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher.
Visible Fat Accumulation - Excess fat deposition is frequently observed around the abdomen, thighs, hips, and arms.
Breathlessness - Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing during physical activity can be a symptom.
Fatigue - Obese people may feel tired, even when doing minor tasks.
Joint and Back Pain - Excessive weight strains the joints, causing osteoarthritis and back pain.
Sleep Disorders - Obesity is linked to sleep apnea, in which breathing stops and starts repeatedly while sleeping.
Skin Problems - Increased sweating, skin irritation in skin folds, and infections as a result of friction and moisture in skin folds.
Psychological Effects - People with obesity frequently experience depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. These symptoms are frequently linked to body image and social stigma.
Chronic Conditions - Obesity has been associated with several major health disorders, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, fatty liver disease, and some malignancies,  
Reproductive Issues - Obese women may have irregular menstruation cycles or infertility due to hormonal abnormalities.

Health Risks of Obesity
There are many health risks associated with obesity, and it can have a negative influence on general health.

1. Type 2 Diabetes -
Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated blood glucose levels. Approximately 90 percent of individuals with type 2 diabetes are obese or overweight. High levels of glucose in the blood have the potential to cause several health complications, such as renal disease, heart disease, stroke, nerve damage, and vision problems.

2. High Blood Pressure -
High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, occurs when blood flows through the blood vessels with greater force than normal. Being overweight can raise blood pressure because it requires the heart to work harder to pump blood to every cell in the body. Additionally, damage to the kidneys from excess fat might affect blood pressure regulation. Hypertension may cause strain on the heart, affect blood vessels, and increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, kidney disorder, and death.

3. Heart Diseases -
Heart disease refers to a variety of health conditions affecting the heart, including heart failure, heart attack, angina, and an irregular heart rhythm. Being overweight or obese raises the chance of having heart-related disorders such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and high blood glucose.

4. Stroke -
A stroke results from the blockage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain or neck, which stops blood flow to a portion of the brain. A stroke can cause brain damage that impairs speech and body movement.

5. Metabolic Syndrome -
Metabolic syndrome refers to a group of diseases that raise the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Three or more of the following symptoms must be present for a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.
Large waist measurement.
Elevated blood triglyceride level.
Elevated blood pressure.
Elevated blood glucose levels while fasting.
Low blood levels of HDL cholesterol, or the "good" cholesterol.

6. Fatty Liver Diseases -
Fatty liver disease occurs when fat accumulates in the liver, resulting in cirrhosis, severe liver damage, or even liver failure. These conditions include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Overweight or obese individuals are more frequently affected by NAFLD and NASH. NAFLD and NASH can also occur in people with metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, high blood fat levels, type 2 diabetes, and certain genes.

7. Cancers -
Adipose (fat) tissue produces a variety of proteins and hormones called adipokines. Leptin is one adipokine that is overproduced in obese people and may stimulate the proliferation of cancer cells.

8. Mental Health Problems -
Obesity can have an impact on both physical and mental health and lead to the chance of developing
Chronic stress.
Concerns with body image.
Low self-esteem.
Depression.
Eating disorders.
Sexual function problems.

9. Sexual Health Problems -
Obesity may also raise the risk of experiencing sexual function issues. Obesity and being overweight increase the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED), a disorder in which men cannot maintain or get an erection adequate for fulfilling sexual activity. Some research has examined the potential effects of obesity on female sexual function, including the possibility of causing issues with orgasm, lack of desire, inability to get or maintain arousal, and pain during intercourse.

10. Fertility Problems -
Obesity can lead to reduced sperm count and quality in men. Obesity in women is associated with issues related to ovulation and the menstrual cycle. Additionally, obesity can affect the effectiveness of several infertility therapies or procedures.

11. Pregnancy Problems -
Being overweight and obese raises the risk of developing health problems during pregnancy that can affect the pregnancy and the baby's health. Pregnant people who are obese may have a greater chance of
Developing gestational diabetes, or diabetes that occurs during pregnancy.
Having preeclampsia, or high blood pressure during pregnancy can cause severe health problems for the pregnant person and baby if left untreated.
Needing a cesarean delivery or c-section and taking longer to recover after giving birth.
Having complications from surgery and anesthesia, especially if they have severe obesity.
Gaining more weight or continuing to be overweight or obese after the baby is born.

12. Asthma - 
Asthma is a long-term, chronic lung disorder that damages the airways. Air is transported into and out of the lungs through tubes called the airways. Being obese raises the chances of getting asthma, worsens the symptoms, and makes it more difficult to control symptoms.

13. Sleep Apnea -
Sleep apnea is a common condition that can occur while sleeping. Sleep apnea is characterized by obstruction of the upper airway, which results in irregular or intermittent cessation of breathing. Untreated sleep apnea increases the risk of developing several health concerns, including heart disease and diabetes.

14. Osteoarthritis -
Osteoarthritis is a prevalent, long-term condition that impairs joint movement and produces pain, edema, and stiffness. Obesity increases the risk of osteoarthritis in the hips, knees, and ankles.

15. Gout -
Gout is a form of arthritis characterized by joint pain and swelling. Uric acid crystals accumulate in the joints, leading to the development of gout. Male gender, high blood pressure, obesity, and consumption of purine-rich foods are the risk factors.

16. Kidney Disease -
Obesity increases the risk of diabetes and high blood pressure, which are the primary causes of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Obesity may raise the risk of getting chronic kidney disease (CKD) and worsen its progression even in the absence of diabetes or high blood pressure.

How to Measure a BMI?
Body mass index is the most commonly used method to determine a healthy weight (BMI).

BMI, or Body Mass Index 
The BMI is a measurement of an ideal weight for height. The NHS BMI healthy weight calculator will help determine the body mass index or BMI.
Most adults with a BMI of:
are underweight if their BMI is less than 18.5.
are healthy if the BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9.
are overweight if their BMI is between 25 and 29.9.
are obese if the BMI is 30 to 39.9.
are severely obese if their BMI is 40 or older.

One must use a lower BMI score to determine overweight and obesity if the person is from an Asian, Chinese, Middle Eastern, Black African, or African-Caribbean family:
23 to 27.4 indicates overweight.
27.5 or higher indicates the obese category.

The BMI score has some restrictions because it determines whether a person is overweight but not obese. For instance, highly muscular individuals, such as athletes, can have a high BMI without being significantly obese. However, BMI is a helpful indicator of a healthy weight for the 
majority of people.

How to Measure a Waist to Height Ratio?
The waist-to-height ratio is another metric for assessing extra fat that can be applied to persons with BMIs < 35.

To find the ratio of waist to height:
Determine the midpoint between the hip bone and the lowest rib. This should be nearly level with the belly button.
Wrap the tape measure about this midpoint, breathing freely and without holding the tummy in.
Divide the measurement (in centimeters or inches) by the height, measured in the same units.

For example, if one's height is 160 cm and waist is 80 cm, one would compute the result as 80 divided by 160 or 0.5. If the waist-to-height ratio is 0.5 or higher, one may be at higher risk for health problems.

Statistics -
Obesity is a growing pandemic in this country. The following provides helpful data, statistics, and facts on obesity and its effects on the US population.

Obesity -
It has been reported that 93 million Americans suffer from obesity in the US.
Obese people are at greater risk of having reduced mobility and face the severe social stigma that comes with obesity.
Obesity and socioeconomic level are closely related. Minority communities with low incomes are more prone to be overweight and to experience obesity at a higher rate.
In 2001, the top five countries for obese people were Mississippi, West Virginia, Michigan, Kentucky, and Indiana.
The annual death rate of obesity is close to 112,000.
Forty percent of adults in the US are not involved in any kind of recreational physical activity.

Severe Obesity -
Overweight, obesity, or severe obesity greatly raises the risk of several other diseases, including osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and stroke.
Severe obesity is defined as exceeding 100 pounds above their ideal body weight or having a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or above.
Environmental, genetic, and behavioral factors cause severe obesity.
In 2002, 25 percent of people suffering from extreme obesity were treated for six or more obesity-related diseases.

Childhood Obesity -
Obesity affects around 9 million adolescents (children and teenagers aged 6 to 19).
Obesity in children has a 70 percent higher probability of affecting an adult when they get older.
Early-life childhood obesity predisposes children to obesity and severe obesity in adulthood.
Environmental factors, including improved technology and a lack of physical activity, have contributed to a more sedentary lifestyle.
Today, children with obesity are considerably more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.
Childhood obesity rates have been highest among African Americans, Hispanics, and American Indians. These ethnic groups have an average of 25 percent of the children suffering from obesity.

Ten Lesser Known Facts About Obesity 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines obesity as a BMI of 30 or higher. 
Obesity is associated with more than 60 diseases and health issues, including:
Depression.
Fertility issues.
Joint Pain.
Breathing problems.
Diabetes.
Stroke.
Heart disease.
The prevalence of obesity has almost doubled globally since 1980.
The fifth most common cause of death globally is obesity.
One in every six children in the United States is overweight.
The average medical bill for an obese person is nearly $1,500 higher than that of a healthy-weight person.
Obesity is most common during middle age.
Colorado has one of the lowest obesity rates. Colorado leads the US in low obesity rates, followed by Hawaii, Washington, Massachusetts, and California. Americans consume 23 percent more calories than 50 years ago.
Obese people miss 56 percent more work than people of normal weight.
A BMI of 30 or higher is associated with a 93-fold increased risk of diabetes.

Three Common Misconceptions About Obesity

1. Obesity Is a Lifestyle Choice and Not a Disease. 
Considerations of obesity as a disease - When one constantly eats more calories than the body needs, it causes fat cells to grow larger. It increases the overall size of fat tissue. This leads to health issues related to excess fat (like sleep apnea, joint problems affecting mobility, and skin irritation) and causes dysfunction in fat cells and fat tissue. This dysfunction, called adiposopathy, can lead to immune and hormone imbalances that contribute to common metabolic disorders seen in medical care, such as high blood sugar, high blood pressure, increased levels of harmful fats in the blood, heart disease, and cancer.

2. An Increase in Body Weight Is Always Due to an Increase in Body Fat. Those With Decreased Muscle and Normal Body Weight Do Not Develop Complications of Obesity.
A body mass index (BMI) of 25 kg/m2 or higher is generally considered overweight, and a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher is considered diagnostic for obesity. However, BMI might not always give an accurate picture of every person. It also varies depending on race, gender, and menopausal status. People with a lot of muscle can have a high BMI without having a high body fat percentage. On the other hand, some people with less muscle mass might have a normal BMI but still have a high percentage of body fat, which is called sarcopenic obesity. People with sarcopenic obesity have a higher risk of conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.

3. Obesity Is Mostly Due to a Defined Genetic Abnormality. 
Many people think that their obesity is mainly due to their genes. However, it is not usually caused by a specific genetic problem. Obesity does have a genetic aspect and tends to run in families. Estimates show that about 60 percent of the genetic influence on obesity comes from multiple genes working together rather than a single, clear genetic issue.


## Article: Obesity and Its Impacts

Economic and Social Impacts of Obesity 
Overweight and obesity lead to an economic impact on both nations and individuals. The most notable are the direct medical expenses related to treating disorders linked to obesity. Compared to people of lower weight, obese people are much more likely to need home medical care, outpatient appointments, lots of medication, be admitted to the hospital, and have surgery. The expenses of care and hospital stays are higher for obese patients.
The economic effects of obesity involve indirect expenses associated with decreased or stopped productivity and human resources. 
Research from several different nations demonstrates that people who are obese miss more work days due to absenteeism and perform less well at work while they are present (presenteeism). 
Obesity also raises the risk of unemployment and reduces income. 
Premature deaths from conditions linked to obesity suggest a loss of future economic contributions. 
Studies have shown that obesity has significant negative economic effects in certain nations. Estimates of medical expenses and lost productivity range from 0.13 percent of GDP in Thailand to 9.3 percent in the USA. 

Future Economic Impacts of Obesity

In 2008, obesity cost the US $147 billion in medical expenses, and this number is expected to keep rising. It is not just about healthcare—obesity also leads to $4.3 billion in lost productivity due to absenteeism. By 2018, obesity-related medical costs made up 8.5 percent of total healthcare spending. By 2030, these costs could jump to $48 to $66 billion annually. To meet the demand for healthier options, the food industry is shifting towards more nutritious products, with a global market projected to reach $1 trillion by 2027. These numbers show the urgent need for action to address obesity through healthcare, workplace policies, and better consumer choices.

Recent Updates

In 2016, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology and the American College of Endocrinology recommended a new nomenclature for obesity: "adiposity-based chronic disease (ABCD)."
World Obesity Day, an internationally recognized event, will be celebrated on March 4 rather than October 11. It is an annual event that raises awareness and advocates for real solutions to the worldwide obesity issue.
Researchers have discovered a protein that inhibits brown fat function. This new discovery may safely activate brown fat while addressing obesity and other health issues.

WHO Statistics  
In 2022, the prevalence of obesity globally stood at 1 in 8 individuals. From the year 1990, the rate of adult obesity worldwide has enormously doubled, while adolescent obesity has quadrupled. In the same year, about 2.5 billion adults aged 18 years and above were categorized as overweight, with 890 million individuals among them suffering from obesity. Moreover, 43 percent of adults aged 18 years and older were overweight, with 16 percent of them being obese. Among children under the age of 5, 37 million individuals were overweight. Furthermore, in 2022, over 390 million children and adolescents aged 5 to 19 years were overweight. Amongst them, 160 million were living with obesity.

## Article: Confronting Obesity: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention

WHO Strategies for Prevention and Management
The prevention and management of overweight and obesity, along with associated non-communicable comorbidities, are primarily within reach and are controllable. At the individual level, people can reduce their risks of obesity by following preventive measures across various life stages, which start very early from the pre-conception stage and extend through the early years. These measures include:
Appropriate weight gain during pregnancy must be ensured with the treating physician in nearby health centers.
Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months must be ensured postpartum, and breastfeeding should continue for 24 months or more.
Children should be encouraged to adopt healthy habits regarding nutrition, adequate physical activity, sedentary behaviors, and proper sleep, regardless of their current weight.
Children and adolescents should reduce their screen time and engage in outdoor sports.
Restriction of sugar-sweetened beverages and nutrient-rich foods while promoting healthier eating habits.
Individuals must adopt a balanced lifestyle comprising a healthy diet, physical activity, proper sleep, tobacco and alcohol restriction, and emotional self-regulation.
One should restrain energy intake from fats and sugars while also increasing the consumption of whole grains, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and nuts.

Adipose tissue has evolved as an adaptive response to the intermittent availability of food. During periods of abundance of food, surplus calories are converted into triglycerides and stored efficiently within the large lipid droplets found in fat cells. These stored triglycerides act as a readily accessible energy reserve. When required, such as during periods of food scarcity, triglycerides are immediately broken down into free fatty acids and glycerol. These breakdown products then serve as a vital energy source for various tissues and organs throughout the body, ensuring survival and sustenance during limited food availability.
Obesity occurs when energy intake constantly surpasses energy expenditure, leading to the sustained accumulation of excessive triglycerides in adipose tissue. This condition is cumulative, meaning that even a minor daily surplus of energy intake over expenditure, as little as 7 kcaL per day, can result in obesity over several years or decades. It is imperative to note that despite the prevalence of obesity, there are individuals within these populations who do not fall into the overweight category. This emphasizes the complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors in determining individual weight status.

Role of Leptin
Leptin, a hormone that inhibits food intake, usually increases as fat stores expand. However, this mechanism alone does not always prevent obesity. Evolutionary factors and the nature of leptin's role shed light on this phenomenon. Leptin can strongly defend against losing body fat, thereby triggering excess food intake when its levels drop below an individual's usual level. However, the response to elevated leptin levels is less decided. At higher levels, administering additional leptin may have little to no effect, a phenomenon known as leptin resistance.
Obesity control measures by healthcare providers:
Assessment of weight and height of individuals accessing healthcare facilities.
Provide counseling on healthy dietary choices and lifestyle practices.
Comprehensive obesity prevention and management services can be provided upon diagnosis, including guidance on diet, exercise, and medical and surgical interventions if required. 
Monitoring for other risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, such as blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipids, and assessing the existence of comorbidities and disabilities, including mental health disorders.

## Article: No Article
Key Policies
Individual dietary choices and physical activity are shaped mainly by external influences, such as societal and environmental factors, which can limit their personal choices. Ultimately, fighting obesity requires a collective effort rather than individual effort, highlighting the establishment of supportive environments and communities where healthy eating and regular exercise are easily achievable, accessible, and affordable components of everyday life.
Comprehensive and multisectoral measures are indispensable to slow down the upward trend of obesity effectively. These should comprise various domains, including marketing strategies, food production, pricing policies, and other measures aimed at addressing overarching health determinants like urban development and poverty alleviation.
To curb obesity effectively, the following need to be mandatory:
Enact structural, fiscal, and regulatory policies to cultivate environments that encourage healthier food options and ensure they are accessible, abundant, and appealing to consumers.
Improvise healthcare sector capabilities to identify, prevent, treat, and seamlessly manage obesity and integrate these endeavors into broader frameworks targeting non-communicable diseases. This approach involves strengthening health systems through a primary healthcare model.

The food industry contributions include:
Reduction of fat, sugar, and salt content in processed foods.
Ensure that healthy and nutritious foods are accessible and affordable for all consumers.
Strict regulation of the marketing of foods high in sugars, salt, and fats, particularly those that target children and adolescents.
Support the availability of healthy food choices.

## Article: Confronting Obesity: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention
Diagnosis
Healthcare professionals should assess all adult patients for obesity and offer comprehensive counseling, as well as behavioral interventions, focused on achieving lasting weight reduction. The evaluation process for obesity includes four primary steps: 
Conduct a targeted history of obesity-related aspects such as lifestyle habits, diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management.
A physical examination is performed to establish the extent and nature of obesity.
Evaluation of any associated medical conditions.
Estimation of patient's readiness to embrace new lifestyle modifications.

## Article: Confronting Obesity: Diagnosis, Treatment, and Prevention
Obesity Measurement
Efforts are underway to develop more sensible and effective assessments for identifying high-risk individuals, drifting beyond reliance solely on the BMI scale. Like staging systems used for conditions like chronic kidney disease, the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology (AACE) guidelines and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) propose a straightforward and clinically suitable treatment system for obesity. This system will incorporate ethnic-specific BMI thresholds along with evaluations for complications related to obesity. This stage has the following stages:

Stage 0 -  Individuals without complications despite being overweight or obese according to the BMI scale.
Stage 1 - Individuals with mild to moderate complications are categorized.
Stage 2 - Individuals with severe complications. 

Conversely, the Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) provides a varied functional staging approach, classifying obese individuals into five graded categories (0 to 4) based on their morbidity and health risk profiles across three medical, functional, and mental factors. This is significant as the staging in the EOSS is conducted independently of BMI.

Stage 0: No risk factors, physical and psychological symptoms, or limitations experienced by the individual. 
Stage 1: There can be light physical complaints, existing risk factors, light psychological complaints, or constricted well-being. 
Stage 2: There can be pronounced risk factors that require medical care, moderate psychological complaints, and moderate limitations in daily activities.
Stage 3: There can be significant end-organ damage, considerable psychological complaints, severe functional limitations, or severe deterioration of well-being.
Stage 4: Chronic disease due to obesity, grave psychological symptoms, or grave functional hindrances.

Treatment Strategies
Treatment goals for obesity aim at improving related health issues, enhancing quality of life, and minimizing the risk of complications. Thorough medical history, physical examination, and tests help determine risk and plan treatment. The intensity and choice of treatment depend on the patient's risk level, preferences, and available resources. Not all obese patients require treatment based purely on BMI, as it does not directly measure body fat or overall health. However, those with obesity-related health problems should receive active treatment. Treatment involves lifestyle changes initially and might include medication or surgery, depending on the BMI category.

An Ideal weight loss goal: A realistic goal is losing 8 to 10 percent of body weight over six months.

1. Lifestyle Management
Obesity management targets three crucial aspects of lifestyle: eating habits, physical activity, and behavior modifications. Since obesity arises due to an imbalance in energy, patients need to learn the principles of energy consumption (diet), expenditure (physical activity), and integration into daily activities (behavioral therapy). Research indicates that lifestyle changes can lead to a moderate weight loss of around 3 to 5 kg compared to receiving no treatment or usual care.

2. Diet Therapy 
Diet therapy mainly targets cutting down on calories. 
Following recommendations from leading health organizations like the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and The Obesity Society, treatment most often starts by minimizing daily calorie intake by 500 to 750 calories compared to what the person usually eats. 
Women can aim for 1200 to 1500 calories per day, and men for 1500 to 1800 calories per day (modified for body weight), targeting a weight loss of about 1 to 2 pounds per week. 
This can be consummated by swapping out some foods for healthier options, like choosing smaller meal portions, adding more fruits and vegetables, choosing whole-grain foods, lean meats, and low-fat dairy, and cutting back on fried foods, fatty foods, and sugary drinks. 
It is necessary for dietary advice to focus on the individual and set specific, achievable goals.
The diet's balance of nutrients relies on personal food preferences and health conditions. 
The 2020 U.S. Dietary Guidelines suggest a diet high in whole grains, fiber, fruits,  and vegetables while keeping added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats under 10 percent of daily calories. 
Using meal replacements can result in 7 to 8 percent of weight loss. However, the mix of nutrients in the diet solely depends on what the person likes to consume, how they cook, their culture, and any health issues they might have.
Another method of evaluating a diet is to examine its energy density (the number of calories in a given amount of food). 
People usually eat about the same volume of food regardless of how many calories it has. 
Foods with low energy density, like soups, vegetables, fruits, and lean meats, can help manage hunger and aid in weight loss. 
But foods high in energy density, like cheese, pretzels, and red meat, can result in weight gain.
In certain cases, very low-calorie diets (VLCDs) may be suggested for quick weight loss over 3 to 6 months. 
These diets typically provide fewer than 800 calories daily, along with protein and essential nutrients. 
They are suggested for people who are very focused on losing weight, especially if they are moderately to severely obese and have not had success with other methods. 
VLCDs should be monitored by healthcare professionals in a medical setting with careful monitoring and lifestyle support.

3. Physical Activity
A combination of exercise and dietary changes is the best way to manage and treat obesity. Exercise is mandatory for keeping weight off. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines suggest that adults aim for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity weekly. Simple ways to be more active in daily life include using stairs, walking briskly, doing chores, or playing sports. It is also necessary to sit less, as too much sitting is linked to health risks. Keeping track of daily activity with an accelerometer or pedometer is also recommended, which can help, as step counts show how active one is. Everyday activities are as important as structured workouts for getting fit and losing weight. One must be very active (more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity every week) to lose weight. These exercise goals may seem difficult at first, so one must start gradually. Getting advice from an exercise expert or personal trainer will also help.

4. Behavioral Therapy
Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is utilized to help people adopt and stick to new habits related to diet and exercise. This includes strategies like keeping track of meals and physical activity, stress management, controlling triggers (like using smaller plates or avoiding eating while watching television), seeking support from others, resolving problems, and minimizing negative thoughts. It is helpful for them to record plans to foresee progression. Since these techniques can be time-consuming, they are often supervised by other staff in the doctor's office, like a nurse practitioner or dietitian.

5. Pharmacotherapy
Medications may be considered for certain patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or higher or for those with a BMI of 27 kg/m2 or higher who have obesity-related conditions and other conservative approaches have failed. When prescribing anti-obesity drugs, it is vital for patients to actively participate in a lifestyle program that guides them in the use of medication effectively, as this can maximize overall weight loss. 

These medications tend to fall into two categories: appetite suppressants and drugs that reduce fat absorption in the gut. Since 2012, the FDA has approved four new medications to help manage weight long-term, although one was withdrawn voluntarily in February 2020. These medications work by affecting hunger, fullness after eating, and how the body responds to high-calorie foods, which can aid patients to stick to their calorie-restricted diets easily. Additionally, in 2020, a new capsule considered a medical device was introduced to the market.

The Oral Device Gelesis 100 was approved by the FDA in 2019. It is a kind of gel that does not enter the bloodstream and dissolves in water. The capsule releases a gel made of cellulose inside the stomach, which absorbs water and forms a substance similar to food that fills up to 25 percent of the stomach volume. In the large intestine, the enzymes will break it down, and the cellulose is expelled from the body. This treatment does not pose any further risks. These capsules are approved for individuals with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or higher, with or without other health conditions.

6. Surgical Interventions
Bariatric surgery is a choice for individuals with severe obesity (BMI more than or equal to 40 kg/m2) or moderate obesity (BMI more than or equal to 35 kg/m2) with associated health problems. Traditionally, weight-loss surgeries have been classified based on their effect on the anatomy: restrictive, restrictive, malabsorptive, and malabsorptive procedures. However, recent research has shown that the metabolic benefits of bariatric surgery, including weight loss and improvement in metabolic conditions, are primarily due to alterations in the gut hormones, gut microbiota, bile acid metabolism, and adipose tissue metabolism. 

Restrictive surgeries can minimize the stomach's capacity and hinder the emptying process. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding was introduced with the LAP-BAND in the United States in 2001. Unlike earlier models, this band's diameter is adjustable through a connection to a reservoir that will be implanted beneath the skin. Injecting or removing saline from the reservoir can tighten or loosen the band, which can lead to alterations in the stomach size opening. Although the average weight loss percentage after five years is around 20 to 25 percent, longer-term benefits have been less satisfactory, leading to less use of this procedure.
In laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, the stomach will be restricted by vertically stapling and dividing it, which can remove approximately 80 percent of the greater curvature, thereby leaving a slender, banana-shaped portion along the lesser curvature. Weight loss that follows this procedure surpasses that of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding.

Effect of Obesity on Mental Health:
Obesity can usually cause emotional challenges like mood swings, low self-esteem, and body image issues, which can affect treatment and prognosis. That is why most obesity treatment teams also include mental health experts to support patients with these issues. Fortunately, losing weight can enhance mental well-being, especially for the ones shedding a significant amount, like those who have undergone bariatric surgery. However, some people have recurring mental health issues or develop new ones after losing weight. Even if weight is regained, psychological struggles do persist. This stresses the significance of physicians assessing mental health at the start of treatment, tracking changes during weight loss, and being alert to any worsening symptoms if weight is regained.

Effect of Gender-Reaffirmation Hormonal Drugs on Causing Obesity
Transgender individuals tend to use gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) to align their physical appearance with their gender identity, focusing on improving their quality of life. While GAHT can lead to low long-term risks, transgender women can have a slightly higher chance of experiencing venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). In contrast, transgender men may encounter acne, polycythemia, and alopecia. Guidelines from the Endocrine Society and World Professional Association for Transgender Health suggest that the hormone levels be maintained within the expected range for the affirmed gender and avoid excessive doses of GAHT to reduce these risks.
However, research on how BMI changes in transgender individuals undergoing GAHT is scarce, and studies are still ongoing. Some studies suggest that transgender women have experienced a remarkable increase in BMI after 12 months of GAHT, while transgender men show higher BMI levels after six months and up to 54 months of GAHT. Nevertheless, more long-term studies, especially in the United States, are deemed necessary to get a better insight into the impact of GAHT on BMI.

Purpose of Weight Loss Drugs in Combating Obesity
Obesity is the largest and fastest-growing public health concern and mainly occurs due to an imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. It is a heterogeneous condition with different causes and varies among individuals. Approximately 70 percent of adults in the United States are affected by obesity. If left unmanaged, obesity can lead to major comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes, myocardial infarction, osteoarthritis, etc. Weight loss drugs or anti-obesity medicines are prescribed to individuals who are overweight or obese due to various conditions. 

Body mass index (BMI) is the most common method of measuring obesity; it is calculated based on the individual's height and weight. Weight loss drugs are recommended for people who have failed to achieve significant weight loss after approximately six months of lifestyle modifications or for individuals with a body mass index of more than 30 kg/sq.m (kilogram per square meter). Several weight loss drugs have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA), but it is always recommended to consult an expert healthcare professional before taking them. These drugs, when combined with lifestyle and behavior modifications, can help lose excess weight and also maintain appropriate weight. 

Pharmacotherapy for obesity has recently attracted attention globally from both patients and healthcare professionals; however, the amount of extra weight loss can be attributed to approximately less than 5 kg (11 lbs) in one year. Nevertheless, this weight loss has also contributed to improvements in glycemic control, hypertension, insulin sensitivity, and dyslipidemia in obese patients. The main aim of weight management is to prevent cardiovascular risks and reduce obesity-related morbidity and mortality, and these weight-loss drugs are shown to possess these additional benefits.

As the name suggests, the main purpose of weight loss drugs is to help individuals reduce excess weight according to their body mass index and maintain it for a prolonged period. Weight loss drugs work on different mechanisms; some drugs just curb the appetite and are recommended for the short term only, as the long-term use of weight loss drugs may not be suitable for many individuals. Other groups of drugs act by either increasing the metabolism of the body or decreasing the absorption of fat, ultimately causing weight loss. However, as obesity is a chronic condition, pharmacotherapy may be required lifelong, along with physical activities, good nutrition, and behavioral counseling. 


What Are the Primary Mechanisms of Action for Weight Loss Drugs?
Many factors contribute to obesity or overweight, and weight-loss drugs are recommended depending on the causative factors and the individual's general health. Depending on the mechanism of action, anti-obesity drugs are classified into three groups: drugs that interfere with fat absorption, drugs that lower food intake, drugs that increase energy expenditure, and drugs that increase thermogenesis.

Drugs That Interfere With Fat Absorption: Orlistat is a medication approved for the long-term management of obesity. It is a reversible gastrointestinal lipase inhibitor that inactivates the hydrolyzation of dietary fat, thus preventing its absorption by about 30 percent and decreasing the patient's calorie intake. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in obese adolescents aged 12 to 16 years for 54 weeks to assess the effect of Orlistat on body composition and weight. At the end of the study, it was observed that the BMI was reduced from the baseline by 0.55 with Orlistat, but in placebo, it was increased by 0.31. Therefore, Orlistat combined with exercise, diet, and behavioral modification demonstrated statistically significant improvement in weight management. In the adolescent population, the use of Orlistat for up to one year is considered to be safe. 

A recent randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study in adolescents revealed that Orlistat did not significantly affect weight loss at six months. Hence, more research is necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of Orlistat in adolescents. Some common side effects of Orlistat include bloating sensations, abdominal pain, flatulence, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. It may be due to unabsorbed fat present in the intestine. Vitamin supplementation is recommended in long-term treatment with Orlistat patients because reduced fat absorption can cause a deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K.

Drugs That Lower Food Intake: These drugs primarily act on the neurotransmitters to reduce food intake and include serotonergic drugs, noradrenergic drugs, serotonergic and adrenergic drugs, cannabinoid receptors, and certain peptides that lower the appetite or cause a feeling of satiety. Noradrenergic drugs such as Amphetamine, Phentermine, and Diethylpropion act by releasing norepinephrine and blocking its uptake into neurons, thus affecting food intake. However, Amphetamine can cause dependency, and hence it is not recommended for treating obesity. A meta-analysis study of anti-obesity drugs has shown that Phentermine used along with lifestyle modifications was found to be associated with a statistically significant mean weight loss of 3.6 kg (7.9 lbs) at six months, compared to 3 kg (6.6 lbs) in patients treated with Diethylpropion.

Comparative studies conducted for 12 weeks of Phentermine and Diethylpropion revealed that patients treated with phentermine saw greater weight loss and reductions in heart rate and blood pressure. Some side effects of Phentermine and Diethylpropion include irritability, insomnia, headache, nervousness, and palpitations. However, both drugs are restricted for short-term use of less than 12 weeks.
Serotonergic medications such as Fenfluramine and Dexfenfluramine act mainly by releasing serotonin and generating a feeling of satiety, especially for fats, thus reducing food intake. However, these medications were associated with heart valve damage and primary pulmonary hypertension, and hence, the US FDA withdrew them. 

Sibutramine is a serotonergic and adrenergic drug approved by the USFDA, which works mainly by inhibiting serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. It suppresses the appetite, increases thermogenesis, and causes a feeling of satiety. It is one of the drugs approved for long-term management of obesity. Sibutramine is effective in patients with a BMI of more than 25 kg/sq m and is known to reduce approximately 4.45 kg (9.8 lbs) in 12 months. However, the weight was regained after the treatment was discontinued. Studies have also demonstrated that Sibutramine lowered the levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, SCOUT trial, included 10742 patients with hypertension, type 2 diabetes, or cardiovascular diseases. These patients received a single-blind Sibutramine for six weeks, which showed a significant reduction in body weight, systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and waist circumference. However, some common side effects include insomnia, dry mouth, headache, and constipation. Sibutramine is not associated with drug dependency, pulmonary hypertension, or heart valve damage.

Drugs That Increase Energy Expenditure and Thermogenesis: This category includes drugs such as Ephedrine and Caffeine. A long-term, placebo-controlled study showed that combining Caffeine and Ephedrine greatly affected weight loss compared to using them alone. However, this combination has not been approved by the USFDA for weight-reducing treatment.

What Are the Different Types of Weight Loss Drugs Available, and How Do They Differ?
Weight loss drugs are available as oral tablets and injections that can be self-administered. They work in different ways to treat obesity and overweight, depending on the group to which they belong. Current pharmacotherapy for obesity mainly targets neurohormonal dysregulations that are responsible for weight gain and also prevent sustained weight loss and its complications. Different weight loss drugs:
Tirzepatide: It is a recent weight loss drug and is administered subcutaneously once a week. Studies (SURMONT-1) have demonstrated that participants lost up to 21 percent of their body weight using the 15 mg dose, once a week.
Orlistat: It is approved for adult and adolescent obesity and works by blocking certain enzymes such as gastrointestinal lipases, reducing the amount of fat absorption from the food consumed, thus promoting weight loss. In the United States, a lower dose of 60 mg three times a day is approved for over-the-counter use. However, clinical studies have shown that participants lost significant weight during the first year of treatment with Orlistat but regained half as much weight during the second year. The drug has been demonstrated to lower serum glucose levels and improve insulin sensitivity. It also reduces low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
Phentermine - Topiramate: Phentermine is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant and Topiramate is an anticonvulsant drug. This combination therapy was approved by the USFDA in 2012 for long-term treatment of obesity in adults with a BMI of 30 kg/sq m or a BMI of more than 27 kg/sq m with at least one weight-related disorder. It increases the release of Norepinephrine and decreases its uptake in hypothalamic nuclei, thus resulting in decreased food intake. It also works as an adrenergic agonist by activating the sympathetic nervous system and increasing energy expenditure. The drug lowers the appetite, reduces hunger, and creates a feeling of fullness.
Semaglutide: This drug is used for individuals with obesity and rare inherited disorders. It mimics a hormone known as glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and targets the area of the brain that regulates food intake and appetite. The FDA approves it under different names and dosages, and it also helps treat type 2 diabetes. It is also known to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in obese individuals. A once-a-week dose of Semaglutide has demonstrated an average of 15 percent weight loss in adults and about 16 percent reduction in BMI in children above 12 years. 
Setmelanotide: It acts by activating melanocortin receptors, reduces the appetite and calorie intake, and causes a feeling of fullness. It also increases metabolism, thus helping with weight loss. However, it does not treat genetic defects.
Liraglutide: It also mimics GLP-1 and targets the sites of the brain that regulate appetite and food intake. It is also approved by the US FDA and helps in treating type 2 diabetes.
Naltrexone - Bupropion: Naltrexone is used in the treatment of opioid and alcohol addiction, and Bupropion helps to treat depression. This combination therapy is very effective as it reduces hunger, boosts metabolism, and develops a sensation of fullness sooner during food intake.

What Are the Benefits and Limitations of Using Weight Loss Drugs As Part of a Treatment Plan? 
Benefits of Weight-Loss Drugs:
Drugs such as Semaglutide, Liraglutide, Sibutramine, Orlistat, etc, are beneficial as they help in treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.
Weight-loss drugs help people lose more weight (approximately 3 to 12 percent) than only lifestyle changes.
It also helps in reducing the symptoms of osteoarthritis, hypertension, sleep apnea, and skin-related problems.
These drugs provide a significant boost to individuals who are overweight, thus enhancing their confidence and giving motivation.
Reducing excess weight prevents various systemic conditions and helps improve overall health and well-being.

## Article: The Ultimate Guide to Weight Loss Drugs
Limitations of Weight-Loss Drugs:
Weight loss drugs can be rapid and beneficial only for a short time in many people, and hence, maintaining an ideal weight can be challenging in the long term. Most of the people gain back weight after discontinuing these drugs.
Most weight loss drugs can be effective only when used with regular physical activity and dietary changes.
Weight-loss drugs may not be suitable for everyone and are associated with side effects such as constipation (difficulty passing stools), nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, diarrhea (loose or watery stools), mood changes, palpitations (irregular heartbeat), etc.
These drugs can be expensive as most of them are not included under insurance and hence may not be affordable or can cause financial burdens to many people.
Weight-loss drugs can be addictive or habit-forming as they affect the mood and suppress the appetite.
Weight loss drugs are not recommended for pregnant and lactating women.
The long-term effects of these weight-loss drugs are not entirely understood.

Importance of Lifestyle Changes Alongside Medication
Lifestyle medicine mainly focuses on healthy eating, increased physical activity, stress management, avoiding substance abuse, adequate sleep, and good social behavior. Lifestyle modifications provide cognitive and behavioral strategies that help individuals to regulate their energy intake. This also strengthens the highly integrated gut-brain neuroendocrine system, facilitating energy homeostasis and preventing body mass loss. Weight loss can also be achieved by consuming healthy food, reducing calorie intake, and incorporating physical activities, which, in turn, can prevent diabetes and heart diseases. However, it is always recommended to consult a healthcare professional or a certified nutritionist before making any significant changes in the diet, as it may lead to severe fatigue, headache, or nutritional deficiencies.

Staying physically active or incorporating a daily exercise routine can improve brain and heart health and help people lose weight. According to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, approximately 150 minutes of moderate physical activities like aerobics, brisk walking, dancing, etc, in a week. Studies have also shown that exercise can increase the absorption of certain medications due to improved blood circulation to the tissues. Many doctors initially recommend diet changes, regular exercise, and weight loss to lower blood pressure and cholesterol and prevent obesity. When these measures are ineffective, medicines are prescribed. However, continuing a healthy diet, and physical activity with medications is necessary to achieve better results. 

Preference for medications and lifestyle modifications are considered major factors in the management of chronic diseases. Researchers have gathered data regarding smoking, alcohol use, physical activity, and weight among 40,000 adults with no history of cardiovascular diseases and compared people who were prescribed medicines for high cholesterol and high blood pressure and those who are under medication. This study demonstrated that people taking medicines tend to exercise less and gain more weight. Around 82 percent were more likely to be obese compared to people who were not using any medications. This can be because many people assume that after starting medications, they no longer need to exercise or eat healthy food. However, medications also have certain limitations and side effects, whereas healthy lifestyle habits can improve overall well-being and help the medicines to be more effective. 
Traditional lifestyle modification begins by monitoring food intake and physical activity, which are necessary for maintaining an energy balance. Many individuals are often surprised by the high-calorie content in the morning juices, lunches, beverages, and evening snacks or fast foods, which is compensated by a 30-minute daily walk. Therefore, healthcare professionals emphasize reducing portion sizes, fat, and sugar intake and avoiding junk foods, which may reduce the intake by approximately 500 to 750 kcal/day. Consumption of a personalized balanced diet is also recommended based on the individual's BMI. Roughly 15 percent of energy must be obtained from proteins, 20 to 35 percent from fats, and the remaining from carbohydrates is preferred, or it can be slightly modified (25 percent from proteins) to meet the diet preferences. Strategies such as shopping only for the specific food products required, checking nutritional value before consumption, eating home-cooked meals, and storing foods out of sight can be beneficial in reducing the daily calorie intake. Starting physical activities such as aerobics or walking initially for around 150 minutes per week and gradually increasing up to 250 minutes; monitoring the weight at least weekly; and adjusting the eating patterns and physical activity based on the weight change is suggested for weight-loss maintenance.

Lifestyle changes are a more natural method and are considered an integral component in weight loss management. Researchers believe that similar to the medical therapies for hypertension, type 2 diabetes has transformed the management of these conditions. The new generation treatment has the potential to manage obesity along with lifestyle modifications. This can help improve the lipid panel, weight reduction, insulin resistance, and blood pressure. However, these changes must be personalized depending on the BMI and health condition of the individuals to strengthen their implementation and maintain compliance in the long term.

Section 3 - Types of Weight Loss Drugs 

There are different subsets of weight loss drugs, each category with unique therapeutic traits and attributes. The categorization of different weight loss drugs is achieved by setting up and framing specifications or criteria, which demarcate and delineate each drug group, though they all are aimed at downscaling the body weight. 

How Are Weight Loss Drugs Categorized Based on Working Principles?
Therapeutic strategies like weight loss drugs could prompt weight loss. The innumerable medicaments retailed across the globe under the name weight loss drugs. However, not all of these drugs downgrade body weight through the same strategy. Each subset of weight loss drugs employs its own strategy to remove extra pounds so that one can maintain a body weight within the range that is cited to be healthy and fit. 

Considering the working principle with which weight loss medicines palliate the body weight, it could be categorized into the following subsets:

1. Appetite Suppressants -
Ingesting more calories instigates weight gain, so to downgrade body weight, the calorie intake ought to be compromised. Appetite suppressants are a weight loss drug group that promotes weight loss by withholding and muting the expression of hunger. As appetite suppressants cover up hunger or appetite, it enables the person to cut down on food intake, which directly reduces the calorie intake. 

Appetite suppressants rely on the body's chemical messengers and protein molecules to inflict gut fullness. Appetite suppression is instituted through hormones (ghrelin, insulin, cortisol, and leptin), GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1—proteinaceous entity), and neurotransmitters (serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid). 

2. Metabolic Modulators -
The metabolic modulator drug group brings forth weight loss by tempering and tuning the body's metabolism, which is the way by which energy or calories are expended. Upscaling the energy expenditure forces more of the calories to burn up; this is how metabolic modulation favors weight loss.  

3. Fat Absorption Inhibitors -
This particular weight loss drug group brings out its therapeutic implications in weight loss by repressing the uptake and processing of dietary fats. Fat absorption inhibitors obstruct the fat molecules from getting uptaken from the intestines; thus, the fat molecules will be expelled out and unabsorbed. This skips the calories that would otherwise be absorbed from the dietary fats. 

4. Thermogenic Agents -
Another potential weight loss drug class is the thermogenic agent, where weight loss is prompted by underscoring thermogenesis. It is through thermogenesis that the body keeps up its normal temperature. However, it is achieved through the expense of calories. Thermogenic drugs gravitate to calorie expenditure through thermogenesis. The calorie expenditure directly leverages the weight loss. Both thermogenic drugs and metabolic modulator drugs flag overlapping attributes. 

## Article: The Ultimate Guide to Weight Loss Drugs
Which Are the Popular Weight Loss Drugs?
Let's check out the popular weight loss drug from each of the weight loss drug groups:
1. Appetite Suppressants -
Phentermine: Phentermine interrupts and cuts off the brain's hunger signals. Phentermine could be employed either alone or with other weight-loss drugs. Lomaira and Adipex-P are the brand names under which Phentermine is being marketed. 
Lorcaserin: Lorcaserin inflicts gut fullness through its serotonin receptor agonism and thereby mitigates calorie intake. Tablet form is the routine advocated Lorcaserin formulation, which is retailed as Belviq.
Liraglutide: Appetite suppression is brought out by simulating the activities of GLP-1. Saxenda is the Liraglutide formulation for subcutaneous (formulation deposited underneath the skin) delivery.  
Benzphetamine: It downturns hunger and thus expedites weight loss. Benzphetamine therapy should never be teamed with other drugs, not even with other weight loss medications. Regimex and Didrex are Benztamine's in-demand brands.

2. Fat Absorption Inhibitor -
Orlistat: Orlistat disables and mutes the activities of the pancreatic and gastric lipases, which are implicated in fat breakdown and uptake. Under Orlistat's influence, around 25 percent of the dietary fats consumed will be stamped out as unabsorbed. Xenical and Alli are the brand denominations for the Orlistat formulation. 

3. Metabolic Modulator Drugs -
Recombinant Leptin: Recombinant leptin works by upscaling the body's metabolic process, which in turn gears up energy expenditure. Therefore, more calories get exploited, which gravitates to the weight loss process. Apart from being a metabolic enhancer, Recombinant leptin also invokes gut fullness by instigating appetite suppression. 

4. Thermogenic Agents -
Ephedrine: Ephedrine brings forth weight loss by augmenting thermogenesis. Ephedrine and caffeine combination has deepened the thermogenic attributes and thereby potentiates the efficacy in bringing down the body weight. 
Sibutramine: Sibutramine also upregulates thermogenesis. In addition, it could also bring about appetite suppression.

Which Weight Loss Drugs Has the FDA Recalled in the Recent Past?
Considering the safety profile, the FDA has withdrawn and called back a few of its approved weight-loss medications and suspended their marketing licensure. 
Lorcaserin: Post-marketing assessment and analysis unmasked that Lorcaserin could gravitate to certain cancers. Thus, Lorcaserin was eventually recalled and cleared from the market in 2020.
Sibutramine: Sibutramine therapy appreciably heightens cardiovascular disease prospects. As its beneficial attributes failed to offset the cardiovascular threat it could pose, the FDA withdrew it from the market in 2010. 
Rimonabant: Post-marketing studies concerning Rimonabant underscored its gravity for bringing up psychiatric issues, particularly suicidality. Therefore, the FDA called back Rimonabant's marketing license in 2008.
Dexfenfluramine and Fenfluramine: The FDA called back two medicaments, Dexfenfluramine and Fenfluramine, owing to their potency in invoking cardiovascular issues, particularly heart valve impairments and hypertension (inflated blood pressure). The callback of Dexfenfluramine and Fenfluramine was initiated in 1997.

Novel Additions to Weight Loss Drugs
Let's take a quick look at the novel additions to weight loss pharmacotherapeutics. 
Zepbound is a novel addition to weight loss drugs, which secured FDA endorsement in Nov 2023. It is a Tirzepatide formulation, an apt choice for those with concurrent medical issues. It holds back hunger by decelerating the channeling of food across the stomach and intestine. 
Maridebart cafraglutide is another emerging candidate that has just completed phase 1 of the clinical trial. The outcomes from the phase 1 trial underscored that appreciable and enduring weight loss could be yielded through Maridebart cafraglutide. Owing to its fewer-dosing frequency regimen, Maridebart cafraglutide's safety profile outweighs the hallmark set by other weight-loss drugs. 
Gliprons are a discrete category of weight loss pills surviving the phase 3 clinical trial. Danuglipron and Orforglipron are the two medicaments of the glipron subset currently under investigation and scrutiny to acquire a green signal from the FDA. The therapeutic attributes reflected by gliprons are superlative and could bring a breakthrough in the weight loss journey.

What Are the Preferred Dosages of Different Weight Loss Drugs?
The medical team frames the dosage of the weight loss drug such that it could render maximum therapeutic outcomes with minimal safety threats. 

1. Phentermine-Topiramate (Pill) -
Phentermine-Topiramate is advocated for teenagers (over 12 years) and adults.
Daily dose for the initial two weeks: 23 milligrams (mg) of Topiramate with 3.75 milligrams of Phentermine.
Daily for the subsequent 12 weeks: 46 mg Topiramate with 7.5 mg Phentermine.
Daily for the subsequent two weeks: 69 mg Topiramate with 11.25 mg Phentermine.
Following this, the drug dose might be upregulated considering the patient's response, provided it should not outstrip the safer limit of 92 mg Topiramate with 15 mg Phentermine. 

2. Liraglutide (Subcutaneous Injection) -
Initial daily dose: 0.6 mg for one week.
Dosage titration: The dose is upregulated every week, capped at three milligrams. 


3. Semaglutide (Subcutaneous Injection) -
Weekly dose (first week to fourth week): 0.25 milligrams.
Weekly dose (fifth to eighth week): 0.5 milligrams.
Weekly dose (ninth to 12th week): one milligram.
Weekly dose (13th to 16th week): 1.7 milligrams.
Weekly dose (maintenance phase from the 17th week): Ranges across 1.7 to 2.4 mg. 

4. Orlistat (Pill) -
120 milligrams thrice daily.
Alongside fatty main course.

5. Setmelanotide (Subcutaneous Dose) -
Adult Dosing Schedule:
Daily dose for the first two weeks: Two mg.
Daily dose during the maintenance phase: one to three mg. 
Pediatric (Six to 12 Years) Dosing Schedule:
Daily dose for the first two weeks: Half the adult dose (one mg).
Daily dose during the maintenance phase: 0.5 to three mg.

Which Are the Weight Loss Drugs That Are Suitable Even in the Presence of Other Underlying Medical Conditions?
Certain weight loss drugs are safer even if one has other medical comorbidities. However, that does not imply the universal applicability of all weight loss drugs. Specific weight loss drugs are nominated for specific medical scenarios. Therefore, it is imperative to get medical advice before initiating any weight loss medicinal therapies to ascertain therapeutic efficacy with minimal safety considerations. 

1. Weight Loss Drug With Added Anti-diabetic Attributes -
Semaglutide: In addition to its potency as a weight loss drug, Semaglutide could augment insulin release and thus downturn the blood sugar level. 
Liraglutide: Liraglutide also appreciates insulin release, which is coupled with depreciation in glucagon release. Both these attributes palliate blood sugar proportions. 
Orlistat: Orlistat reviews and upgrades the cell's receptive to insulin hormones, thus uplifting the effectiveness of insulin. 

2. Weight Loss Drugs That Could Mitigate Hyperlipidemia (Elevated Cholesterol Proportion in Plasma) -
Orlistat, despite being a weight loss drug, can downscale the cholesterol proportions in blood by masking the cholesterol absorption. 


3. Weight Loss Drugs That Could Support Cardiovascular Health -
Semaglutide could upscale the cardiovascular profile by upholding the cardiovascular parameters. Blood pressure and vascular health projected commendatory outcomes with Semaglutide. Therefore, it is being designated as the hallmark weight loss drug choice for those with an appreciable inclination for cardiovascular complexities. The gravity and propensity for heart issues could be turned down by 20 percent with Semaglutide therapy, which was elaborated and underscored through clinical trials. 

4. Weight Loss Drugs That Could Be Advocated in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients -
Orlistat could be considered a competent and appreciable weight loss drug choice for those with chronic kidney impairment. Fecal elimination of Orlistat downturns the inclination for the burden that weight loss drugs could otherwise impose on the kidneys. Having said that, it is up to the doctor's discretion whether to consider Orlistat or not, considering each patient's health and well-being.

Introduction
The recent approvals of newer pharmacological options by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mark a significant step forward in treating obesity. These anti-obesity medications have undergone more thorough development processes, focusing not only on efficacy but also on safety. This cautious approach reflects a deeper understanding of the complexities of obesity, recognizing it as a chronic condition with a tendency for relapse.

By approving these drugs for long-term management, the FDA acknowledges the need for sustained intervention in combating obesity. This shift in perspective is crucial, as it underscores the importance of continuous support and treatment for individuals struggling with weight management. Furthermore, the availability of a variety of anti-obesity medications provides healthcare providers with a broader range of options to tailor treatment plans according to individual patient needs. This personalized approach can enhance patient outcomes by addressing specific factors contributing to obesity and maximizing treatment effectiveness.[1]

Various Anti-Obesity Drugs Approved by the FDA and Used in the United States (U.S) are:[2]

Newer Anti-Obesity Medications Under Development
Several newer anti-obesity medications are currently under development, aiming to address the complex nature of obesity with improved efficacy and safety profiles. These medications represent a promising frontier in the ongoing effort to combat obesity and its associated health risks. Figure 1 presents various anti-obesity medications under development.

Figure 1: Anti-Obesity Medications Under Development.

Semaglutide
Semaglutide is a type of long-acting GLP-1 analog that can be taken once a week. On the other hand, Liraglutide is a short-acting GLP-1 analog that needs to be taken every day. Both Semaglutide and Liraglutide have been recently approved in North America, Europe, and Japan as treatments for T2DM. Semaglutide is quite similar to Liraglutide, and it not only helps to regulate blood sugar like native GLP-1 but also reduces energy intake, increases satiety, and decreases hunger.

Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide and GLP-1
The hormone GLP-1 is produced by L cells found in the lower small intestine and colon, while GIP is produced by K cells located in the upper part of the small intestine. On the other hand, glucagon is secreted by α-cells located in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. GLP-1 helps to decrease appetite and reduce energy intake, while GIP does not have any effect on dietary behavior.

Combined GLP-1, Oxyntomodulin, and Peptide YY
Oxyntomodulin (OXM) is a 37-amino-acid naturally occurring peptide released from the oxyntic (fundic) cells of the colon after meals. OXM has a dual role as an agonist for GLP1R (glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor) and GCGR (glucagon receptor), leading to decreased appetite and increased energy expenditure in humans. The term GOP refers to a solution that contains a mixture of GLP-1, OXM, and peptide YY (PYY).

Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter-2 Inhibitors 
SGLT-2 inhibitors, such as dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin, are a new class of anti-diabetes drugs that block glucose reabsorption from the renal tubules. This results in glycosuria, which leads to an energy deficit. Previous randomized control trials (RCTs) have reported that these selective SGLT2 inhibitors can effectively reduce body weight in diabetic patients with and without obesity. Typically, patients experienced a reduction of 1 to 3 kilograms in weight.

Leucine-Metformin-Sildenafil Combination 
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) are proteins that regulate lipid and energy metabolism. They prevent fat accumulation and promote fatty acid oxidation through reciprocal activation. L-leucine is an allosteric activator of Sirt1, and Metformin is a synergistic coactivator of sirtuin pathway signaling. Nitric oxide (NO) also stimulates Sirt1, which can be enhanced by Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor.

Clinical Evidence on Success Rate of Anti-Obesity Drugs Compared with Placebo
According to different published studies and clinical trials on weight loss medications, a few anti-obesity drugs have proven to be successful in effective weight loss treatment when compared to placebo among the study participants. However, the range of glycemic control for each drug showed different results. Liraglutide and semaglutide demonstrate a high efficacy in glycemic control. These drugs are potent in managing blood glucose levels. Orlistat and bupropion exhibit moderate efficacy in glycemic control. Bupropion-naltrexone, however, does not show any specific indication for glycemic control. The evidence-based clinical effectiveness of different weight loss drugs as compared to placebo is presented in figure 4 below.

Comorbidities and Risks Associated with Weight Loss Drugs
It is crucial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of treatments for the various health conditions associated with obesity, just as it is standard practice to evaluate treatments for patients with renal or hepatic impairment. However, despite the FDA recommendations to include patients "at the extremes of weight" in clinical trials, there is no regulatory mandate or incentive for pharmaceutical companies to involve individuals with obesity during the approval process of a new medication. It is worth noting that while 42 percent of US adults are affected by obesity, the prevalence rates for kidney disease and liver disease are significantly lower at 2.2 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively. Figure 5 presents the percentage prevalence of common chronic diseases among adults in the United States, as reported by the CDC.

Points to be Considered Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs - 

Medical Evaluation - Before starting weight loss drugs, the patient should undergo a medical examination with an experienced healthcare professional. The evaluation helps determine whether the patient is suitable for the administration of such drugs based on their overall health, test reports, and ongoing medications. 

## Article: Essential Considerations Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs

Pre-existing Medical Conditions
Underlying or pre-existing disorders like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, thyroid, or metabolic problems can affect the patient's normal metabolism and hamper weight management. There are certain drugs that are indicated in diabetes and obesity; and are also considered weight loss drugs. 
Healthcare professionals try to customize the course of the drug according to the patient's history and pre-existing disorder to minimize the potential side effects or consider alternative options for weight loss. 

## Article: Essential Considerations Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs

Medication History
While evaluating the administration of weight loss drugs, an individual's medication history matters. Certain drugs may interact with weight loss drugs and lead to severe health complications. 
Certain medications like antidepressants, corticosteroids, antipsychotics, and some diabetes medications can lead to health or weight-related side effects.

Past Weight Loss Attempts
Recording previous methods and weight-losing attempts can help the healthcare professional understand what suits best for the patients.
Individuals may have had success with certain weight loss strategies in the past.
Past weight loss attempts may have been hindered by specific challenges or barriers. Healthcare providers can identify these challenges and develop strategies to overcome them, potentially increasing the likelihood of success with weight loss drugs.

## Article: Essential Considerations Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs

Psychological and Behavioral Factors
Psychological and behavioral factors are very important aspects taken into account before starting on weight loss drugs. 
People suffering from problems like emotional eating use food as a coping mechanism for stress, anxiety, depression, or other mental or emotional issues. Healthcare professionals need to understand the patient's eating patterns before starting the weight loss drugs.
Binge eating disorder is characterized by recurrent episodes of bringing along with the feeling of loss of control. People with such problems need special treatment before starting on weight loss drugs.
Many people are concerned about their body type. Body types such as pear, inverted triangle, hourglass, and others may vary. These shapes can impact an individual's self-esteem.
By understanding all these aspects, doctors can identify the triggering factors, behavioral patterns, overeating habits, or other emotional problems and plan a strategy that may be effective and support successful weight loss efforts. 

## Article: Essential Considerations Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs

Dietary Habits
People have certain types of dietary patterns, which gives an insight into their eating habits, preferences, and nutritional intake. It is very important to understand the patient's dietary patterns that may result in nutritional deficiencies, such as inadequate intake of vitamins, minerals, or essential nutrients. Healthcare providers evaluate nutritional status and address any deficiencies before initiating weight loss drugs. 
Healthcare providers can confirm dietary restrictions or preferences, such as non-vegetarian, vegetarian, or vegan, and food allergies, intolerances, or sensitivities, and plan meals accordingly, which may be suitable for a positive outcome during the administration of weight loss drugs. Sometimes, cultural and social factors may also vary the outcomes.

Sleep Patterns
Sleep patterns are mostly overlooked in weight management. Any sleep-related issue can impact the weight loss journey. Sleep disorders such as insomnia, sleep apnea, or other sleep disorders may cause disrupted sleep and affect weight management.
Proper sleep, duration of sleep, and quality of sleep are important for overall health, metabolism, and weight regulation. Healthcare providers assess an individual's sleep duration, efficiency, and quality to identify deficits or disturbances contributing to weight gain or hindering weight loss efforts.
Sleep plays a vital role in regulating hormones in appetite control, metabolism, and energy balance. Disruptions in sleep patterns, such as insufficient or irregular sleep schedules, can affect hormonal regulation. Hormones like leptin, ghrelin, insulin, and cortisol lead to increased appetite, reduced satiety, and alterations in metabolism that promote weight gain.

## Article: Essential Considerations Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs

Family History
Genetic predisposition of weight-related issues should be considered before initiating weight loss drugs. Healthcare providers understand the familial patterns of obesity, overweight, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other related health conditions to identify genetic predispositions that may impact weight management.

## Article: Essential Considerations Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs

Pregnancy and Reproductive History
Pregnancy and reproductive history are important considerations before initiating weight loss drugs due to their potential impact on fertility, maternal health, and pregnancy outcomes.
Weight loss drugs may affect fertility and reproductive functions, affecting the menstrual cycle, ovulation, and conception.
Concerns related to postpartum weight gain require special attention before administering weight loss drugs because some factors like breastfeeding status, sleep deprivation, hormonal changes, and the impact of caregiving responsibilities on diet and exercise habits need to be considered.

Importance of BMI Before Considering Weight Loss Drugs
The administration of weight loss drugs can be a successful approach toward a healthier lifestyle, but before starting, the body mass index plays an important role. Patients can be categorized by BMI - below 25 normal and above 25 to 30 obese. Weight-loss drugs are typically recommended for healthy individuals with a BMI of 30 or higher or those with a BMI between 27 and 30 who have health issues like hypertension or diabetes. It is also recognized that people with BMIs below 25 can have weight-related health problems, and weight loss can help improve these conditions. So, deciding whether weight-loss drugs are right for someone is based on individual health circumstances and BMI.

## Article: Essential Considerations Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs


When Should One Start Considering Weight Loss Medication?
FDA guidelines suggest that weight-loss medications might be an option for individuals who have diligently attempted lifestyle modifications and meet one or more of the following criteria:
A body mass index (BMI) equal to or greater than 30.
A BMI equal to or greater than 27 and one or more obesity-related conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes.
An inability to lose at least five percent of total body weight within three to six months solely through lifestyle changes.

## Article: Essential Considerations Before Taking Weight Loss Drugs

Criteria for Case Selection and Contraindicated Patients
Healthcare providers consider several factors to ensure patient safety and treatment effectiveness when considering weight loss drugs. 

Criteria for Case Selection -
Body Mass Index (BMI) - A BMI of 30 or higher is typically used as a guideline for those who may benefit from weight loss medication. However, individuals with a BMI of 27 or higher may also be considered if they have comorbidities like type 2 diabetes or high blood pressure.
Comorbidities - Obesity-related comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or obstructive sleep apnea may be suitable indicators for weight loss drugs.
Risk of Obesity-related Complications - Individuals with a high risk of obesity-related complications, such as cardiovascular disease or joint problems, may benefit from weight loss medications.
Failure of Lifestyle Interventions - Patients who have not achieved significant weight loss with lifestyle modification like trying diet, exercise, or behavioral therapy can be candidates for weight loss drugs.
Patient Motivation and Compliance - Patients should be confident and motivated to lose weight and be willing to continue the treatment regimen, including regular follow-ups with healthcare providers.
Absence of Contraindications - Patients should not have any absolute contraindications to the specific weight loss medication being considered.


## Article: Obesity and Its Impacts

Cost of Obesity 
Obesity is a significant risk for chronic illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, which contribute significantly to healthcare spending in America. According to the Milken Institute, obesity had a total economic and social impact of nearly $1.4 trillion in 2018, which includes $370 billion in medical costs for obesity-related illnesses and $1 trillion in indirect costs such as lost workdays. A study by KFF found that people who have been diagnosed with obesity or are overweight spend more than twice the amount of money on healthcare costs as those who have not been diagnosed. On average, those diagnosed with obesity or being overweight have healthcare costs of $12,588 per year, while those without a diagnosis have healthcare costs of $4,699 per year. Those with a diagnosis of obesity have experienced an increase of 37 percent in out-of-pocket costs, while those without a diagnosis have experienced an increase of 25 percent. There are several reasons why people with obesity may have higher healthcare costs, including the direct cost of treating obesity and the cost of treating related conditions such as high cholesterol, hypertension, and high blood sugar.

Obesity rates tend to be higher in the Midwest and Southern regions of the United States. Despite various efforts to combat obesity, Arkansas continues to report some of the highest obesity rates in the country, with 34.7 percent of adults and 23.8 percent of public school-age children affected. A report by the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement (ACHI) found that medical and drug expenses increase with the severity of obesity. Health plans in Arkansas spent an average of 31 percent more on individuals with obesity than on those without.

Insurance Coverage Is a Challenge
Many insurance companies may offer claims against anti-obesity treatment, but more than 70 percent of the insurance policies do not cover this treatment. Cost may affect the choice of treatment for a patient. It is seen that most of the coverage is determined state by state. So, some states have anti-obesity medication as part of their essential health benefits package, but most do not. For those without insurance coverage for weight-loss drugs, out-of-pocket costs in the U.S. can be over $1,300 a month for Wegovy or $1,060 for Zepbound.  Costs for these drugs are much lower in some other countries. For example, Wegovy is nearly four times more expensive in the United States than in Germany, where the drug list price is $328. 

## Article:  No Article
In the case of employment insurance, big companies may have such insurance that covers anti-obesity treatment but not all companies. However, there has been a bill in Congress for about a decade called TROA - the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, to try to get Medicare to cover these medications. The Treat and Reduce Obesity Act (TROA) is a bipartisan law that helps Medicare beneficiaries get better access to safe and effective treatments for obesity. It allows Medicare to cover intensive behavioral therapy and FDA-approved anti-obesity medications for older Americans.

Section 6 - Patient Questions About Weight Loss Drugs
1. What Should One Expect When Taking Weight Loss Drugs?
It is important to realize that the effects of weight-loss drugs can differ based on the type of medication, the health profile, and lifestyle choices. One must consult a healthcare expert before beginning any drug for weight loss. They will evaluate the individual's medical history, existing prescriptions, potential risk factors, and weight reduction objectives to ascertain whether a weight loss medication suits the person. A few points to consider when using medicines for weight loss include:
Possible Weight Loss: Weight loss medications can help people lose weight through various methods. Some medications function by decreasing hunger, which helps one feel fuller sooner or lessens the desire for high-calorie foods. Others might speed up metabolism or prevent the digestive tract from absorbing fat. Depending on the medication and personal circumstances, one might lose weight gradually over time.
A cohort study of 175 subjects with obesity under Semaglutide revealed that the subjects lost 5.9 percent of body weight at the end of three months and 10.9 percent weight loss by the end of six months. The results suggested that the outcomes of Semaglutide treatment in a clinical setting were similar to those obtained in clinical trials. Another recent meta-analysis revealed that weight reduction percentages ranged from 2.9 to 6.8 percent for Phentermine, Liraglutide, Naltrexone, Orlistat, and Lorcaserin. However, later in 2020, Lorcaserin was withdrawn from the market because a clinical trial for drug safety exposed its carcinogenic potential.
Possible Side Effects: Drugs used to lose weight may have adverse consequences, just like any medication. These could be nausea, vomiting, constipation, dry mouth, sleeplessness, or lightheadedness. Although they are uncommon, serious adverse effects can include elevated blood pressure, palpitations, liver damage, or mood swings. It is critical to talk to a healthcare practitioner about possible side effects and report any negative responses immediately.
Lifestyle Modifications: A balanced diet and regular exercise are two healthy lifestyle modifications most effective when used with weight loss drugs. The physician could suggest dietary changes and physical activity levels to maximize the medication's effects.
Monitoring and Follow-Up: The healthcare practitioner will probably need to monitor the patient frequently while using weight loss medications to evaluate the success, check for adverse effects, and modify the therapy if necessary. Having follow-up sessions is crucial for monitoring weight reduction, handling any issues, and guaranteeing the safety and effectiveness of the medicine.
Treatment Duration: The length of weight loss medication treatment can vary based on the patient and the program's objectives. While some drugs are meant to be taken over the long term for weight control, others may be recommended for short-term usage to accelerate weight loss. The healthcare professional will decide on the best action based on one's unique needs and how one responds to the drug.
Health Advantages: Certain weight-loss drugs may also help with blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar regulation, in addition to assisting patients to lose weight. These advantages can improve general health and lower the chance of problems caused by obesity.

2. How Quickly Can One Expect Results, and How Much Weight Can One Lose?
Weight loss medications can cause weight loss, but how quickly and how much depends on the individual, medications, how well the patient adheres to the prescribed course of action, and any other lifestyle modifications. Here is a thorough summary derived from the research:
Timeline for Results: According to short-term research, weight reduction medications may start to show effects a few weeks to a few months after therapy begins. Individual reactions, however, could differ. Certain medications may cause weight loss to occur more quickly at first, but as the body adjusts to the medication, the rate of weight loss may eventually slow down. It is critical to keep reasonable expectations and recognize that sustained weight loss happens gradually instead of quickly.
Amount of Weight Loss: The amount of weight that weight loss medications helps lose varies significantly and depends on several factors. Compared to a placebo (inactive treatment), clinical trials have shown that weight loss drugs can cause a modest but clinically significant reduction in body weight. When using weight reduction medications, people can typically lose five percent to ten percent of their starting body weight over several months to a year. For instance, a 200-pound person may shed 10 to 20 pounds with the proper care. However, each person's experience may be different. Understanding that a mix of medication, dietary adjustments, and increased physical activity is frequently more effective for long-term weight loss is crucial.
Factors Influencing Weight Loss: A person's response to weight reduction medicine may differ depending on several personal characteristics, including age, gender, starting weight, medical history, genetic predisposition, and treatment adherence. A person's diet and exercise routine are important lifestyle factors that affect the success of weight loss medications. Medication with a nutritious diet and frequent exercise can improve weight loss outcomes. Collaborating closely with a healthcare professional is critical to creating a customized treatment plan considering one's unique requirements and objectives.
Long-Term Maintenance: Although diet pills may be helpful in the short run to jumpstart weight reduction, persistent lifestyle, and behavioral adjustments are necessary for long-term weight loss maintenance. Studies indicate that long-term weight control outcomes can be enhanced by combining medicine with comprehensive lifestyle therapies, including exercise regimens, behavioral therapy, and dietary counseling.
3. What Are the Potential Side Effects of Weight Loss Drugs, and How Can They Be Managed?
Like other medications, weight loss treatments may have minor to severe negative effects. It is critical to comprehend these possible adverse effects and management strategies. This is a thorough explanation:
Gastrointestinal Problems: Many drugs used to lose weight affect appetite or the way nutrients are absorbed, which can cause gastrointestinal problems like nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or discomfort in the abdomen. These symptoms typically appear early in treatment and may go away eventually. Among the management techniques is taking the drug with food to reduce gastrointestinal distress. Maintaining hydration, avoiding constipation by consuming lots of water, and eating smaller meals more frequently can help manage nausea.
Elevated Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: Certain medications used to lose weight have the potential to activate the cardiovascular system, resulting in a rise in blood pressure and heart rate. Those with pre-existing cardiovascular issues may find this especially troubling. Among the management techniques are frequent monitoring of heart rate and blood pressure, limiting the use of other stimulants, such as caffeine, to lower the chance of making cardiovascular symptoms worse, and modifying the dosage or stopping the drug if serious adverse effects on the heart manifest.
Sleep Disturbances and Insomnia: Weight loss drugs containing stimulants have the potential to cause sleep disturbances that result in insomnia or difficulties falling asleep. Among the management techniques is taking the drug early in the day to lessen its effect on sleep. Establishing a regular sleep pattern and furnishing a sleeping-friendly atmosphere can help. Before going to bed, try some relaxation exercises like deep breathing or meditation.
Dizziness and Lightheadedness: When using weight reduction drugs, some people may feel dizzy or lightheaded, especially when standing up fast. This may make falls and injuries more likely. One of the management options is to minimize changes in blood pressure by slowly rising from a seated or sleeping position. The user should maintain blood volume and avoid orthostatic hypotension by drinking enough water. If dizziness is severe, avoid tasks that require coordination or balance.
Psychological Effects: For some people, using weight reduction drugs might have an adverse effect on their mood and mental health, resulting in symptoms like anxiety, irritability, or sadness. Among the management techniques is keeping a careful eye on any changes in mood, particularly in the early weeks of treatment. If emotional problems intensify, get help from loved ones, friends, or mental health professionals, and alternate weight loss methods or drugs should be considered.
Drug Interactions: Weight loss drugs may interact with other medications, changing their efficacy or raising the possibility of negative side effects. Among the management techniques are letting medical professionals know about all prescribed drugs, dietary supplements, and herbal remedies and watching for indications of drug interactions, like adjustments to the effectiveness of a prescription or unanticipated adverse effects. If there are major interactions, changing the dosage of medications or selecting a different therapy might help.
4. What Role Do Weight Loss Drugs Play in Improving Fertility for Individuals With Obesity?
Drugs for weight loss can have a major impact on people who struggle with obesity to get pregnant. It is well-recognized that obesity has a negative impact on reproductive health. These impacts include irregular menstrual cycles, ovulatory dysfunction, lower fertility, and a higher risk of pregnancy-related problems such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Changing lifestyle factors like food and exercise is usually the first line of treatment for obesity. However, weight loss medications may be recommended as supplemental therapy for people who struggle to lose weight using these strategies alone.

Often referred to as fat tissue, adipose tissue serves as an endocrine organ secreting various bioactive chemicals called adipokines in addition to being a passive energy storage depot. The metabolic and reproductive disorders linked to obesity are exacerbated by changes in adipokine production and an increase in adipose tissue bulk. Women who have excess adipose tissue worsen PCOS anovulation and may develop hypothalamic hypogonadism. It has been demonstrated that malfunction in the adipose tissue causes a decrease in adipokines such as adiponectin and an increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in PCOS patients. It has been demonstrated that insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes are linked to abnormal adipokine levels. The conversion of androgens to estrogens in adipose tissue inhibits gonadotropin secretion, which in turn impacts follicular growth. Consequently, it appears that nearly every adipokine affects reproduction by resulting in insulin resistance. The table below shows the effect of adipokines on reproduction.


Weight loss drugs can have a positive impact on fertility in men and women. Weight loss medicines employ various mechanisms to facilitate weight loss. Lipase inhibitors, which reduce the absorption of fat, appetite suppressants, and treatments that speed up metabolism are a few popular categories of weight loss drugs. These medications may help people lose weight, which may have a number of positive effects on reproductive results.
Restoring Hormonal Balance: Hormonal abnormalities linked to obesity have the potential to impair healthy reproduction. Losing weight can aid in the restoration of hormonal balance, especially by lowering insulin resistance and women's levels of estrogen and androgens, which can enhance ovulatory function and monthly regularity.
Better Ovulatory Function: One of the main risk factors for ovulatory dysfunction, which can result in infertility, is obesity. By encouraging weight loss, these medications may help obese women regain normal ovulatory function, which will increase their chances of getting pregnant.
Decreased Risky Pregnancies: Obesity raises the chance of developing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, and big birth weight (fetal macrosomia), among other pregnancy issues. Weight reduction medications may lessen these hazards by encouraging weight loss, thus improving the safety of the mother and unborn child during pregnancy.
5. What Are the Potential Risks Regarding Fertility When Using Weight Loss Drugs?
It is critical to understand that there may be potential risks along with benefits for weight loss medications when contemplating this treatment for people who are obese and experiencing fertility problems. Here are some things to think about:
Effectiveness Varies: Although some people may find that taking weight loss medications helps them lose weight, there is a broad range in the effectiveness of these medications. Not everyone responds to these drugs in the same manner, and some people may lose weight only slightly or gain it again after the prescription is stopped. As a result, different people may benefit from weight loss medications to varying degrees.
Hormonal Imbalance: Weight loss drugs may have an impact on hormone balance, which is important for reproductive health. For instance, some drugs may change the amounts of hormones that affect ovulatory function and menstruation, such as insulin, leptin, and adiponectin. Though weight loss drugs may help improve fertility in some obese people. Hormonal imbalances have the potential to worsen pre-existing reproductive problems or cause the development of new ones.
Ovulatory Dysfunction: The ovulatory function may be directly impacted by some weight loss medications. Drugs that enhance metabolism or decrease hunger, for example, may interfere with the hormonal signals required for ovulation. This may lead to anovulation, insufficient ovulation, or irregular menstrual periods, both of which can make conception more difficult.
Potential for Birth Defects: If some weight loss medications are taken while pregnant, there may be a chance of birth defects. Therefore, it's imperative that people who are attempting to conceive or who are already pregnant talk to their healthcare professional about any possible hazards. It could be advised in certain situations to stop taking the medicine before attempting to get pregnant.
Interactions with Fertility Treatments: The usage of weight reduction drugs may interfere with or impact the results of fertility therapies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF) or ovulation induction. To guarantee a safe and efficient course of treatment, it is crucial for patients receiving fertility treatments to disclose to their fertility specialist any medications they are taking, including prescription drugs for weight loss.
Nutritional Shortages: A number of weight reduction medications have the potential to prevent specific nutrients from being absorbed, which can result in nutritional shortages. Reproductive health depends on an adequate diet, and inadequacies in important nutrients, including vitamins and minerals, can affect fertility. The nutritional condition of those taking weight loss medications should be checked, and supplementation may be necessary to avoid deficits.
Psychological Impact: It might be difficult for some people to cope with the psychological strain of infertility and the need to reduce weight. These psychological pressures may be made worse by using weight reduction medications, especially if side effects occur or weight loss goals are not met. Support for mental health may be required to address these issues and enhance general well-being throughout the reproductive process.
6. How Should Individuals Plan to Conceive and Navigate Weight Loss Treatment While Addressing Fertility Concerns?
The patient, their healthcare practitioner, and a reproductive specialist must carefully assess and coordinate the individual's weight loss medication regimen while addressing fertility concerns. Those who are hoping to get pregnant can do the following:
Consultation With Healthcare Practitioner: Patients should have a comprehensive consultation with their primary care physician or a healthcare practitioner specializing in managing obesity before beginning any weight reduction medication treatment. They ought to talk about their wish to become pregnant as well as the possible effects of weight reduction medications on fertility.
Complete Assessment: To determine the person's general health, a complete assessment should be carried out. This includes determining the person's weight, medical history, reproductive health, and any underlying illnesses that may have an impact on fertility. Lab testing, imaging examinations, and evaluations of ovulatory function and hormone balance may all be part of this assessment.
Risk-Benefit Analysis: The medical professional will assist the patient in balancing the possible advantages of weight loss with the potential risks associated with becoming pregnant. They will consider variables including the degree of obesity, underlying illnesses, and past reproductive history. If using weight loss drugs is more advantageous than harmful, a customized treatment strategy can be created.
Choosing a Drug for Weight Loss: Not every medication used to lose weight is appropriate for those who want to get pregnant. There is a greater chance of unfavorable effects on fertility or pregnancy with certain drugs. The medical professional will weigh the safety profile of each drug and select the one best suited to the patient's requirements and reproductive objectives.
Monitoring and Follow-Up: Throughout the course of weight loss medication treatment, routine monitoring and follow-up visits with the healthcare professional are crucial. This makes it possible to closely monitor the rate of weight loss, evaluate any issues or side effects, and modify the treatment plan as necessary.
Integration with Reproductive Care: If the patient is undergoing or has recently begun reproductive treatments, communication between the fertility specialist and the medical professional prescribing the weight loss medication is essential. The use of weight-loss medications by the patient should be disclosed to the reproductive specialist in order to optimize treatment and handle any potential risks or interactions.
Lifestyle Changes: To support their reproductive goals, people should concentrate on adopting healthy lifestyle changes in addition to using weight loss medications. This can entail having a healthy diet, exercising frequently, controlling stress, getting enough sleep, and giving up bad habits like smoking and alcohol consumption.
Preconception Counseling: Consulting a healthcare professional or a reproductive specialist before becoming pregnant can help maximize fertility and get ready for motherhood. This could involve talking about when to get pregnant, taking prenatal vitamins, monitoring fertility, and other things that can increase the chances of getting pregnant and having a healthy baby. Those who intend to get pregnant can safely navigate weight loss medication treatment while optimizing their chances of obtaining a healthy pregnancy by adopting a proactive and coordinated approach that addresses both weight management and fertility problems. The secret to success on this journey is maintaining open lines of communication with healthcare experts and adhering to individualized treatment programs.
7. What Are the Guidelines for Individuals Undergoing Fertility Treatment While Using Weight-Loss Drugs?
Yes, utilizing weight-loss medications while undergoing fertility therapy is advised, along with certain precautions and guidelines. To increase the likelihood of success and guarantee the individual's safety as well as the safety of any possible pregnancy, it is crucial to make sure that weight loss initiatives and fertility treatments are properly coordinated. Here are some guidelines: 
Consultation with a Fertility Specialist: People using weight-loss medications in conjunction with fertility treatment should see a fertility specialist. The individual's reproductive status will be evaluated, treatment choices will be discussed, and advice on how weight loss attempts may affect the results of fertility treatments will be given by the fertility specialist.
Medication Selection: The safety profile of a weight-loss medication during fertility treatment, as well as any potential impacts on reproductive health, should be considered while making this choice. Some weight-loss medications may be safer than others when used in conjunction with reproductive treatments. To choose the best course of action, the fertility specialist and the medical professional writing the prescription for the weight-loss drug should work together.
Timing of Weight Loss Treatment: It is important to consider when to start weight loss treatment in relation to cycles of reproductive treatment. Sometimes, it is advisable to postpone weight loss drugs until after reproductive treatment is finished, especially if the medicine used for weight loss has the potential to harm fertility or cause pregnancy. On the other hand, under close supervision, weight-loss therapy may be started prior to or during reproductive treatment in other circumstances.
Monitoring of Ovulatory Function: Patients receiving reproductive treatment and diet pills need to closely evaluate their ovulatory function. Drugs for weight loss may have an impact on ovulatory function and hormonal balance, which could alter the effectiveness of reproductive treatments. Consistent monitoring with hormone tests and ultrasound examinations can assist in guaranteeing that ovulation is taking place as planned.
Nutritional Support: Drugs used to lose weight may have an impact on metabolism or vitamin absorption, which could result in nutritional deficits. Sufficient nourishment is crucial for both conception and gestation. To make sure their nutritional needs are satisfied, those receiving reproductive therapy who are also taking weight-loss medications may benefit from nutritional counseling and supplementation.
Handling Negative Effects: Treatment for infertility may be impacted by the negative effects of weight reduction medications. It is important to handle common side effects such as headaches, mood swings, and gastrointestinal problems well in order to reduce their negative impacts on treatment results. Patients should notify their healthcare professionals when they experience any negative effects.
Communication with Healthcare Providers: It's critical that the patient receiving therapy, the fertility specialist, and the healthcare professional writing the prescription for the weight-loss medicine keep lines of communication open. Prompt communication of modifications to medicine, treatment plans, or reproductive status is imperative to guarantee optimal outcomes and integrated care.
Patient Education and Support: Patients who are taking weight-loss medications in addition to reproductive therapies should be informed about the possible risks, advantages, and safety measures related to both treatments. In order to answer any worries or inquiries that may come up throughout the course of treatment, they ought to have access to tools and assistance.
Individuals receiving fertility therapy who also use weight-loss medicines should maximize their chances of success while avoiding potential dangers to fertility and pregnancy by adhering to these precautions and advice. To achieve the best results, healthcare providers must work closely together and stick to individualized treatment regimens.

8. What Are Some Success Stories or Research Findings Regarding the Impact of Weight Loss Drugs on Fertility Outcomes?
Pharmacotherapies that focus solely on improving weight include a number of medications that have been used to treat obesity over the years. These treatment options include Orlistat, Sibutramine, Metformin, Phentermine and Topiramate combination, and GLP-1 RA, which includes Exenatide, Dulaglutide, Liraglutide, Semaglutide, Tripeptide, and combinations of GLP-1 RA with amylin analogs. It is still up for debate, though, if the weight loss associated with these medications is related to increased fertility. Below are some outcomes of studies that reveal the effects of each of these drugs on fertility and obesity:
Orlistat: A recent prospective study examined the effects of Orlistat on the reproductive hormone profile and conception rates in 120 obese, infertile women aged 21-35 with a BMI of more than 25. The participants were split into two groups. The first group had six months of Orlistat therapy, which involved taking 120 mg twice a day. The second group had to follow lifestyle changes like diet and exercise. The findings showed that the orlistat group's post-treatment LH plasma concentrations increased statistically. Additionally, a noteworthy distinction was observed in the conception rates between the two groups, with the orlistat group exhibiting superior results. 
Metformin: 34 women with PCOS and prediabetes participated in a prospective, single-blind, randomized pilot trial that compared a 16-week medical therapy of 2000 mg Metformin per day to 5 mg Saxagliptin per day. There were three participant groups: the combined therapy group, the Metformin group, and the Saxagliptin group. All groups showed improvements in insulin sensitivity, waist circumference, and body mass index, with the combined and Saxagliptin groups showing statistically significant reductions in BMI. Also, the combination therapy group's menstrual cycle was more regularized.
Exenatide: In a prospective trial setting, sixty overweight/obese women with PCOS were randomly assigned to receive either Metformin, Exenatide or a combination of pharmacological therapy for a duration of 24 weeks. Three groups participated in the intervention: those receiving 1000 mg Metformin twice a day, those receiving 10 μg Exenatide twice a day, or those receiving 1000 mg Metformin twice a day in addition to 10 μg Exenatide twice a day as a combined therapy. First, all three groups showed statistically significant improvements in weight, with the combined therapy group showing the greatest outcomes. In terms of the hormonal profile, the combined treatment group showed a significant improvement in menstrual cyclicity, while the three therapy groups had considerably lower total testosterone plasma concentrations.
Success Story:
With the increasing popularity of weight-loss medications such as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Mounjaro, some women are investigating the possibility of the medications affecting their ability to conceive. In their quest for a child, Wynter Mitchell-Rohrbaugh revealed to ‘Good Morning America' that she and her husband had already experienced four miscarriages. In-vitro fertilization, or IVF, was the couple's next obstacle, according to Mitchell-Rohrbaugh, who said a doctor informed her she had to drop forty pounds before they could start the procedure. "I simply kept asking myself, Are you crazy? "I am not a petite person," she declared. "I am a plus-size woman."

Mitchell-Rohrbaugh claimed that she used Ozempic, a member of the GLP-1 RAs medication class, to aid in her weight loss. This drug helps reduce blood sugar levels and promotes the production of insulin in the body. The medications reduce hunger and slow down the passage of food through the stomach, which results in weight reduction. Following a five-month use of Ozempic, Mitchell-Rohrbaugh reported losing forty pounds. She started fertility treatment and stopped taking the medicine. After that, Mitchell-Rohrbaugh claimed to have had a successful IVF cycle that resulted in healthy embryos. "To get to that call, 'Wynter, Hi, I have good news,' I just never thought I was going to hear that," said Mitchell-Rohrbaugh.

What Are the Nutritional Deficiencies Associated With Long-Term Use of Weight Loss Drugs, and How Can They Be Managed?
There is an increased chance of severe deficiencies because of taking weight loss drugs in the long term. The deficiencies include:
Vitamin and Mineral Deficiencies: Certain weight loss drugs interfere with fat absorption, which can lead to significant deficiencies, especially of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K. Orlistat is one such medication that has the potential to inhibit the absorption of dietary fats. They act on the lipases to bring out their action. To enlist the various fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies which can be caused by weight loss medications, include: 
Vitamin A.
Vitamin D.
Vitamin E.
Vitamin K.
Vitamin B12.
Calcium.
Iron deficiency.
Zinc deficiency.
Usage of weight loss drugs results in a change in the pattern of nutrient absorption, leading to deficiencies. Therefore, individuals on weight loss medications are usually prescribed vitamin and mineral supplements, particularly fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K.  
How Can Healthcare Providers and Individuals Work Together to Ensure Adequate Nutrition While

Using Weight Loss Drugs for the Long Term?
To have the best outcome while consuming weight loss medications, it is necessary to have a collaborative stance. From the healthcare provider's end, it is advised that regular assessments be conducted to monitor the individual's health and nutritional status. Any side effects must be promptly noted, and dosages adjusted as needed. The healthcare providers must also offer advice and recommendations based on the guidelines and should work towards making a personalized treatment plan. The plan must be focused on fulfilling the nutritional requirements. If there are nutritional deficiencies, appropriate supplements must be provided. Also, the individual must be referred to a nutritionist who can give extra support regarding portion control and balanced eating. Overall, healthcare providers must educate individuals with regard to the benefits and risks in the long term. They must also be available to support them in making informed choices with regard to choosing their foods when on weight loss drugs. All information resources must be made available. Healthcare providers must also keep regular follow-up appointments to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in the long run. Any concerns and challenges faced must be addressed and rectified. 

Discussing challenges, doubts, and concerns is very important from the individual's side. There should be active participation in following the dietary recommendations and guidelines. If nutritional supplements are provided, it is the individual's responsibility to take them on time. This will help address the long-term issue of nutritional deficiencies. In case of any side effect or concern during weight loss supplementation, the individual must present it to the healthcare provider immediately so that the treatment can be modified as needed. Also, individuals need to seek support from healthcare providers and other support professionals whenever they encounter any challenges in the long term.

What Are Some Strategies for Maintaining a Balanced Diet and Addressing Nutritional Needs While Taking Extended Weight-Loss Drugs?
It is important to maintain a healthy and balanced diet so as to meet the nutritional demands of the body, especially while on weight loss treatment. This is achieved by an active lifestyle accompanied by taking expert professional advice. A few strategies to attain this include:
Consultations With Healthcare Professionals: This is important as they can help cater to the needs along with understanding the body's requirements. Also, nutritional deficiencies and side effects encountered during the treatment can be addressed. 
Healthy, Balanced, Nutrient-Rich Diet: There must be an increased emphasis on eating healthy whole foods rather than processed junk food. The body's requirements for vitamins, minerals, and fiber must all be met for overall well-being. 
Portion Control: It is important to limit calorie intake per meal. These measurements must align with weight loss goals and must be approved by a healthcare professional before initiation. Also, techniques such as small plates, serving sizes, and mindful eating help prevent most overeating and regulate portions to a great extent. 
Good Water Intake: It is advised to drink lots of water, as that helps prevent overeating and, thereby, helps regulate weight. 
Proteins.
Healthy fats.
Meal Preparation and Planning: It is highly encouraged to plan and prepare meals and snacks ahead of time so there is no temptation during hunger pouts. 
Supplementation: When associated deficiencies exist, the healthcare provider will prescribe supplements. It is recommended that the individual take them appropriately at the prescribed intervals. 
Monitor on a Regular Basis: It is important to monitor mental and physical health on a regular basis while on a weight loss program. Any negative side effects must be promptly consulted by the doctor.

Section 8 - Use and Impact of Weight Loss Drugs in Individuals With Pre-Existing Medical Conditions

Obesity is considered a common risk factor for the causation of various medical conditions in the human body. When comorbidities set in, people try to lose weight to manage them and prevent unforeseen complications. Weight loss drugs are a major part of this process. While weight loss drugs are effective options, it is necessary to understand their impact on the underlying comorbidities as well. 

Weight Loss Drugs and Medical Conditions:

Semaglutide:
Semaglutide is a drug originally used to manage diabetes mellitus type II. To provide adequate control over glucose levels in the blood, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists were introduced. In recent years, this drug has been recognized as an effective weight loss drug.

How Does Semaglutide Work?
Semaglutide intends to mimic the action of glucagon-like peptide 1 hormone in the body. It works through several mechanisms.
Semaglutide can make the pancreas release more insulin to curb higher glucose levels.
It acts on the brain to reduce appetite and provide a sense of fullness.
It slows down the rate at which the stomach empties, keeping one satisfied and preventing those hunger pangs.
It also helps burn the excess fat in the body and achieve weight loss goals.

Is Semaglutide Effective for Weight Loss?
Now, one might wonder if Semaglutide can help with diabetes mellitus. But does it help with weight loss? Well, as the saying goes, the proof is in the pudding. Several clinical trials have been performed to determine the role of Semaglutide in weight loss. 

SUSTAIN TRIALS:
A SUSTAIN (Semaglutide Unabated Sustainability in Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes) clinical trial was conducted to determine the effectiveness of Semaglutide in treating diabetes mellitus by administering 1 mg of the drug to the subjects. In the sixth phase of the trial, Semaglutide was studied for its potential as a weight loss drug. Results from the SUSTAIN 6 trial demonstrated that participants treated with semaglutide experienced significant weight loss compared to those receiving a placebo. Notably, individuals in the semaglutide group achieved an average weight loss of over five percent over the course of the trial. 

PIONEER TRIALS:
The PIONEER (Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment) clinical trial program focussed on evaluating the efficacy of Semaglutide use in diabetes mellitus. The main focus was to note down its efficiency when given through an oral route. The magnitude of weight loss achievable with this drug was considered a secondary outcome. PIONEER studies also showed that Semaglutide helped reduce waist circumference and BMI as a whole compared to other drugs. As per the PIONEER studies, oral administration of Semaglutide also helped minimize cardiac and renal damage.

STEP TRIALS:
The STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with Obesity) trials are considered the most significant studies for the effectiveness of Semaglutide as a weight loss medication. Results from the STEP trials were groundbreaking, with participants experiencing significant and sustained weight loss across all dosages of semaglutide tested. Notably, some individuals achieved weight loss of 15 percent or more, surpassing expectations and setting a new standard in obesity treatment.

When Should One Not Take Semaglutide?
Semaglutide should be avoided completely in case of thyroxine hormone imbalance, medullary thyroid carcinoma, or multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome.
Patients with pancreatic carcinoma or inflammation, should not consume Semaglutide.
Studies also showed Semaglutide to cause disorders of the gallbladder like cholelithiasis (gallbladder stones). Patients with such pre-existing issues, must avoid taking Semaglutide.
Diabetic retinopathy or loss of vision as a consequence of diabetes is a very common side effect seen with Semaglutide. If there are any changes in visual ability, Semaglutide must be discontinued.

Semaglutide and Cardiovascular Health:
On March 8, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed that the use of Semaglutide (Wegovy) can help in preventing cardiovascular risks and stroke that are generally associated with overweight or obesity.
This is because Semaglutide helps to reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, thus helping the heart pump adequately. The cardiac protective properties of Semaglutide are seen because of the presence of GLP-1 receptors in the heart and blood vessels. Activation of GLP-1 receptors by Semaglutide can, in turn, protect the heart muscles and vascular structures. 
Semaglutide also reduced bad cholesterol levels, thereby preventing any risks associated with increased adiposity.

Semaglutide and Kidney:
Semaglutide has a renoprotective effect, helps reduce albuminuria, and preserves the glomerular filtration rate.

Orlistat 
Orlistat is used in the weight loss regimen and helps reduce fat absorption from the diet. Orlistat reaches the lumen of the intestine and attaches to the site where lipases act. Lipase is the enzyme responsible for fat metabolism. When the lipase activity is inhibited, fat absorption is not possible. Therefore, Orlistat can reduce excessive fat in the body and manage obesity.

Orlistat and Diabetes:
Orlistat is known to provide good glycemic control and improve insulin sensitivity. Studies also show that Orlistat reduces random blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Treatment with Orlistat also gave normal oral glucose tolerance tests in people with and without diabetes. Giving Orlistat with other antidiabetic medicines like Sulfonylureas and GLP-1 receptor agonists provided good glycemic control and significant weight loss.

Orlistat and Cardiovascular Health:
By reducing weight, Orlistat helps inhibit an important risk factor (obesity) for developing cardiovascular diseases.

Bupropion-Naltrexone
Bupropion-Naltrexone (Contrave) is a combination drug used for obesity management. Bupropion works in the brain by inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters like norepinephrine and dopamine. This reduces appetite by increasing the feeling of satiety. Naltrexone is an antagonist of opioid receptors. Naltrexone blocks the beta-opioid receptors in the brain and reduces the rewarding effects of food. One may have fewer food cravings, and the weight loss goal will ultimately be achievable. However, this drug has many considerations. 

Bupropion-Naltrexone and Diabetes:
For people with controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, Bupropion-Naltrexone is given as an adjunct to people whose BMI is more than 27 kg per sq meter. There is always a risk of hypoglycemia developing after taking Bupropion-Naltrexone. So, when one experiences any symptoms of hypoglycemia, one should visit the prescribing doctor to adjust the dose of the given hypoglycemic drug. Regular monitoring of the blood glucose levels is also very essential.

Who Should Not Take Bupropion-Naltrexone?
Bupropion-Naltrexone must be avoided in case of:
Increased blood pressure for a long period of time.
Seizures.
End-stage renal disease.
Bulimia or anorexia.
If the patient is taking opioid drugs or has recently withdrawn from opioid intake, Bupropion-Naltrexone is not indicated.
If the patient is taking antiepileptic drugs, barbiturates, or antidepressants, or has a habit of alcohol consumption, this drug should not be taken.




Liraglutide
Liraglutide (Saxenda) is also a glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist like Semaglutide. However, this drug is not indicated for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. It is given as an adjunctive drug for weight loss management along with reduced caloric intake and physical activities. This drug can be used for people more than 12 years of age. Liraglutide acts on GLP-1 receptors in the brain, reducing appetite and inducing feelings of satiety, which leads to decreased food intake. Additionally, Liraglutide enhances insulin secretion in response to meals, improving glycemic control and reducing hyperinsulinemia associated with increased hunger and weight gain. Furthermore, Liraglutide slows gastric emptying, prolonging the time it takes for food to move through the digestive system, which contributes to feelings of fullness and reduced calorie intake. Moreover, Liraglutide has been shown to increase energy expenditure and promote the breakdown of stored fat, leading to additional weight loss.

When Should One Not Take Liraglutide?
Liraglutide is not indicated if someone has any of the following:
Inflammation or other diseases in the pancreas.
Disease of the gallbladder.
Symptoms of thyroid disease or cancer.
Taking Liraglutide can further exacerbate the existing impaired condition of the kidney and result in hemodialysis for affected patients.
Liraglutide can increase the heart rate and worsen the existing cardiac disease.
Previous history of psychiatric disease.
Gastroparesis (slow emptying of gastric contents).

Liraglutide should not be given with other oral hypoglycemics and weight loss drugs as they may interact and result in excessive hypoglycemia, causing syncope in the affected patients. Also, Liraglutide can induce suicidal intentions in people taking this weight loss drug for many years. So, in case of any depression or suicidal thoughts after taking Liraglutide, the doctor must be informed immediately.

Phentermine - Topiramate 
Phentermine-Topiramate is a combination drug used for managing chronic weight gain. It is given to individuals more than 12 years of age. Phentermine, a sympathomimetic amine, acts as an appetite suppressant by stimulating the release of norepinephrine in the brain, leading to reduced feelings of hunger and increased feelings of fullness. Additionally, Phentermine increases the levels of dopamine and serotonin, neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation and reward processing, which may help control food cravings and emotional eating behaviors. 

On the other hand, Topiramate, an antiepileptic drug, enhances weight loss through multiple pathways. It modulates the activity of neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate, which play roles in appetite regulation and energy balance. Topiramate also appears to affect the activity of certain ion channels and neurotransmitter receptors, leading to reduced food intake and increased energy expenditure. Furthermore, Topiramate may alter the taste perception and preference for certain foods, further contributing to weight loss. 

When Should Phentermine-Topiramate Not Be Taken?
Patients with a history of glaucoma (increased pressure in the eyes), are not indicated for treatment with this drug. This is because the carbonic anhydrase inhibiting properties of Topiramate disturb the balance of aqueous humor in the eyes and increase intraocular pressure.
Phentermine-Topiramate should not be taken if the patient has hyperthyroidism.
In case of a history of renal disorder, the dose of Phentermine-Topiramate should not exceed 7.6 mg/46 mg once daily. The same holds true for hepatic dysfunction.
This drug will not be given if the patient is on antidepressants.

What Are the Other Considerations Regarding Phentermine-Topiramate?
Phentermine-Topiramate can cause electrolyte disturbance in the body and cause metabolic acidosis. So before starting the etherapy, electrolyte levels are monitored.
When this drug is given along with other hypoglycemics to treat diabetes mellitus, there can be a risk of severe hypoglycemia, leading to sudden unconscious state.
Hypotension can also occur if this drug is given with antihypertensive medications.
CNS depression occurs when this drug is taken along with antidepressants or alcohol.
Creatinine levels can increase following the intake of Phentermine-Topiramate. So, regular laboratory investigations are essential.
Kidney stones, hypokalemia, and decreased sweating are other manifestations seen after taking these weight loss drugs.

Setmelanotide
In November 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved Setmelanotide for use in weight loss management in people older than six years of age. This drug is exclusively given to people who have weight gain due to genetic disorders like Bardet-Biedl syndrome, deficiency of proopiomelanocortin (POMC), proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin (PCSK1), or lectin receptor. It is not given for weight gain due to other conditions.

Setmelanotide (Imcivree) is a melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) agonist that acts by mimicking the action of the natural hormone alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH). Its mechanism of action primarily targets the central nervous system, specifically the hypothalamus, which plays a crucial role in regulating appetite and energy balance. By binding to and activating MC4R in the hypothalamus, setmelanotide modulates neural circuits involved in appetite regulation, leading to reduced hunger and increased satiety. This effect is particularly significant in individuals with rare genetic disorders of obesity, such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) deficiency or leptin receptor (LEPR) deficiency, where mutations in genes involved in the melanocortin pathway disrupt normal appetite regulation. Setmelanotide restores the function of the melanocortin pathway, helping to normalize appetite and promote weight loss in these individuals. 

What Are the Considerations for Setmelanotide Intake?
Setmelanotide should only be taken when there is a confirmatory diagnosis of the genetic deficiency.
Setmelanotide intake can cause sexual arousal and penile erection in males. If the erection lasts for more than four hours, emergency management is necessary.
This drug is not given to neonates or children less than six years old.
Skin hyperpigmentation commonly occurs after taking Setmelanotide. Accordingly, a dermatologist should be consulted.

Tirzepatide
Tirzepatide is also a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide. It is used for treating diabetes mellitus (type 2) and has the potential to cause weight loss in overweight or obese patients. 

Who Should Not Take Tirzepatide?
If there is a problem or disease of the pancreas or gallbladder, Tirzepatide is not indicated.
Tirzepatide is contraindicated if the individual has medullary thyroid carcinoma.
It is not given to patients who are already under other oral hypoglycemics. 
Tirzepatide can cause acute kidney injury. Hence, people with renal disease should be monitored regularly after Tirzepatide intake.
If there is blurred vision, Tirzepatide is avoided due to the risk of diabetic retinopathy.

Weight Loss Drugs and Pregnancy
Pregnancy is a beautiful period in a woman's life and there is certainly no need to stress out on reducing weight during this period. The United States Food and Drug Administration completely contraindicates the use of any of the weight loss drugs during pregnancy. This is because there can be significant harm to the growing fetus. There is a huge risk of incidence of birth defects and developmental abnormalities after taking these drugs. Maternal risks of abnormal hemorrhage and heart rate are also seen after taking weight loss drugs. So, generally, weight loss drugs are discontinued at least two months before conceiving. People who are planning to get conceived should inform their doctor so that the drug will be stopped prior to conception.

The pregnancy category of drugs are:

Weight Loss Drugs and Lactation
Weight loss drugs are not given during the lactation period as the drug can pass through breast milk to cause harm to the infants.

Weight Loss Drugs and Postpartum Weight Gain
It is absolutely normal to gain weight during and after pregnancy. To reduce postpartum weight gain, weight loss drugs are prescribed only when the mother stops breastfeeding. Until then, physical activity and diet are the only helpful options. While it is natural for new mothers to want to lose pregnancy weight, the focus should be on gradual, sustainable weight loss that prioritizes overall health and well-being. Crash dieting or rapid weight loss strategies may not be suitable, especially during the postpartum period when the body is still recovering from childbirth and hormonal fluctuations. Doctors prescribe weight loss drugs for postpartum weight gain after considering factors like the health of the mother and baby and the nutritional status. Semaglutide is considered to be a safe drug for postpartum weight gain. However, depending on the hormonal and nutritional status of an individual, a medical professional will prescribe weight-loss drugs accordingly.

Weight Loss Drugs and Oral Contraceptives
Some weight loss drugs may affect the absorption, metabolism, or efficacy of oral contraceptives. For example, certain weight loss medications, such as Orlistat or Tirzepatide, can reduce the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and medications, including oral contraceptives. This could potentially reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives if taken simultaneously. So, people are generally advised to switch to other modes of contraception.


Section 9 - Lifestyle Changes and Other Strategies for Managing Obesity 
## Article: No Article
Importance of Diet and Exercise in Weight Loss:
The health and well-being of a person significantly depends on lifestyle. Several studies have also highlighted the positive impact of lifestyle modifications on one's health. These changes may include quitting alcohol and smoking, diet modifications, and regular exercising, which can minimize the risk of various health-related issues, such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension (increased blood pressure), diabetes (high blood glucose levels), and managing obesity. 
Lifestyle Modifications Include:

## Article: Importance of Diet and Exercise in Weight Loss

Healthy and Nutritious Diet: Adopting a balanced and nutritious diet that includes fruits, whole grains, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Also, portion control and reducing the consumption of sugary and processed foods can be beneficial.
Regular Physical Activity: Regular exercise or any other physical activity, such as jogging, walking, cycling, or strength training, helps manage weight. One should aim for at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic activity per week or 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity.

## Article: Importance of Diet and Exercise in Weight Loss

Sleep Quality: Adequate sleep quality and duration are also necessary, as sleep deprivation is also associated with weight gain. Therefore, improving sleep habits and addressing sleep disorders with a healthcare provider can support weight management.

When discussing lifestyle changes, such as diet modification and incorporating exercise for healthy and sustainable weight loss, people usually do not focus on their daily calorie intake and output, thus struggling to manage obesity effectively. For this reason, it is essential to know that losing weight is one aspect of a weight loss program, and the other important part is weight maintenance, which mainly depends on calorie input and output. The National Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, American Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), and American Diabetes Association (ADA) also recommend exercise as an integral part of weight management programs, along with other dietary changes and modifications. Therefore, one must know about the foods they are eating and the calorie content in them in detail to make their weight loss program effective in the long run. However, this does not mean one should become completely calorie deficient; that is, they consume less (lower than the actual body requirement for proper functioning) and burn more through physical activity and exercise.
Furthermore, too much weight gain not only affects an individual's overall health but also makes them uncomfortable about their own body. The statistical data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show a skyrocketed increase in obesity rates throughout the United States. The World Health Organization (WHO) data reveals that around four million people die from obesity every year across the world. Adult obesity has almost doubled so far since 1980, and adolescent obesity has increased four times. Also, around 2.5 billion are currently overweight, and among them, nearly 840 million have been suffering from obesity since 2022. Moreover, the World  Obesity Prediction reveals that one in seven men and one in five women are expected to be obese by 2030. According to the Journal of American Health Association, the condition is linked to a 30 to 53 percent increase in new diabetes cases in the United States every year, thus increasing medical expenses by 30 to 40 percent higher than those who do not have obesity.
Thus, to improve the current health scenario of obesity in developed and developing countries, it is essential to understand that to achieve optimal health, neither diet nor exercise alone is effective in coping with obesity and the long-term effectiveness of weight loss programs. Thus, lifestyle modifications are necessary, and if one needs to lose weight, one has to design a goal to strike a balance between diet and exercise along with other weight loss strategies one is following, including medication. 
Research also shows that obese people often struggle to decide what type of exercise they should do or what kind of food they must eat or avoid based on calorie content, which can also benefit them in losing weight. A person should know that lesser calorie intake is more effortless than burning excess calories because the metabolism of one's body is not in control. One cannot do many things to increase metabolism rate, and the amount of calories one can burn daily through daily exercise is also bound to certain limits. It often becomes difficult for people to stick to the goal of achieving a healthy weight. Therefore, one can get help from a dietician or nutritionist and get in touch with a fitness expert to help them choose or do the proper exercise that effectively achieves weight loss goals by properly managing the dietary intake and output in weight management goal.
Talking about the benefits of incorporating exercise and diet in a weight loss program, one should know that exercise, especially strength-training exercise, is mainly helpful in keeping the weight off, maintaining the ideal weight, and increasing muscle mass. However, even diet helps gain muscle mass and maintain it for the long run. Limiting a calorie intake but not eating a healthy and balanced diet rich in proteins, fiber, vitamins, and minerals may affect the muscle mass and not the fat in the body. It can reduce one's body weight but will not improve their overall health status, thus causing slow metabolism and preventing them from losing weight in the future. Therefore, one can safely maximize their calorie reduction by contacting diet and fitness coaches to understand better their nutrition and calorie needs for effective weight loss. It is also essential to know that a person's body needs some calories to thrive, and not all calories are to be burned in a weight loss program. The person's diet should contain fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, lean protein, low-fat dairy, and nuts, excluding foods rich in sodium, sugar, and highly processed foods.
One must also limit the calories they drink and stick to tea, coffee, and water. Also, quit beverages with artificial sweeteners, including diet soda and drinks. Some of the exercises and diets, along with their benefits, are mentioned below:


## Article: Effective Behavioral Strategies and Counseling for Obesity Management

Complementary Strategies for Managing Obesity, Such as Behavioral Modifications and Counseling
Besides the lifestyle changes mentioned above, behavioral modification and counseling are principal complementary strategies for managing obesity. They mainly focus on changing one's habits and behaviors associated with physical activity, diet, and lifestyle. Thus, people suffering from obesity are given counseling to make behavioral changes to their lifestyle activities. Counseling can help them address their hurdles or barriers to staying dedicated to physical activity and diet goals. It also motivates them to practice various strategies and promote behavioral modifications. However, in some cases, these lifestyle changes and behavioral modifications alone are not enough to treat or manage obesity effectively. Several other factors contribute to unusual weight gain in a person, such as underlying health conditions, hormonal imbalance, or a family history of weight-related issues. One must approach the healthcare provider and share their dietary intake details without hesitation, along with fitness habits, to help them frame a personalized weight loss plan per the need and current status of one's body and overall health. Behavioral modifications for managing obesity involve:
Setting Weight Loss Goals - One must set a reasonable goal for losing weight, dietary changes, and physical activity. 
Self-Monitoring - It is an integral part of the behavioral modification strategy. One needs to assess and keep track of daily food intake, weight, and physical activity to ensure accountability and awareness. One must note down the food and drink or beverages they have consumed throughout the day and keep track of their daily physical activity. This would help to create self-awareness about lifestyle choices and the modifications required to achieve the goal.
Stimulus Control - It refers to keeping all unhealthy foods out of one's reach or environment and replacing them with healthy foods to reduce cravings.
Problem-Solving - This refers to identifying and resolving issues of not getting time and access to healthy food choices, overcoming hurdles, and practicing a healthy lifestyle.
Cognitive Restructuring - Focuses on eliminating unrealistic beliefs and thoughts about one's body image, weight loss, and food, thus inculcating realistic and positive thinking in one.
Stress Management - Involves developing coping strategies to manage emotional eating and stress, such as engaging in hobbies, using relaxation techniques, and seeking help from others.
Social Support - During a weight loss program, one may also seek help from various support groups, family, and friends for accountability, motivation, and encouragement.
Challenges During Behavioral Modification
Instead of accepting setbacks as failures, one should see them as learning opportunities, reflect on what went wrong, and find ways to improve.
Also, one should understand that setbacks are a normal part of the change process. Thus, individuals should not expect perfection and be patient with themselves.
The process should be celebrated for what has been achieved so far, even if it is small. One must recognize that setbacks do not erase the progress one has already attained.
One can also contact friends, family, or a support group for guidance and encouragement. Having a support system can help one stay motivated and accountable.
One must be kind to oneself during setbacks and treat oneself with forgiveness and understanding, just as one would support one's friends going through a similar situation.
One should keep reminding oneself of why they want to change in the first place. They must reconnect with their motivations and use them as inspiration.
One can also change their approach if the current strategy is ineffective or not working. They must look for different methods or instead seek professional guidance to find a new approach that suits them better.
One should always remember that setbacks are temporary and do not define one's ability to change. Therefore, one should stay resilient and focused and keep moving forward.
Counseling for Managing Obesity
Counseling plays a pivotal role in managing obesity by eliminating the barrier between the patient and the healthcare provider, such as negative attitudes and biases related to weight gain and obesity. Counseling also motivates the person to take preventative measures for the risk of chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension, and coronary heart diseases that may occur due to obesity, and improve their overall health status. However, it is also essential that healthcare providers focus on the individual needs of the patient and understand their emotions that may have an impact due to biases existing in society related to being overweight or obese. Thus, they must offer a personalized treatment plan, focusing on the patient's concerns and how they look forward to managing obesity. 
Various studies have discussed several counseling models to educate individuals about weight and how to manage it effectively. Below are a few counseling models that help healthcare providers frame a weight loss management plan for their patients through practical counseling sessions.
1. Transtheoretical Model (TTM): This model talks about behavior change as a process occurring in stages and is mainly of five types:
Precontemplation: During this stage, people are not considering changing their behavior yet. It is because they still need to learn about the need for change or resist it.
Contemplation: During this stage, people start knowing that they need to change and, thus, consider taking action. They might weigh the pros and cons of changing their behavior.
Preparation: During this stage, people become ready to take action and start planning to change their behavior. They may even look out for resources and support to help them make efforts to change their behavior.
Action: During this stage, people tend to actively modify their behavior and start taking steps to address the issue. They might also begin implementing plans,  strategies, and techniques to support their behavior change.
Maintenance: This is the final stage. In this phase, people have successfully changed their behavior and are working to maintain their new habits over time. They might have to face challenges and need ongoing efforts to prevent relapse.
This model believes that everyone linearly progresses through these stages. An individual may move back and forth between all these stages or get stuck in a particular stage. Thus, this model recognizes behavior change as a complex process and considers different strategies that may be effective at various stages.
2. 5 A's Model: This is the most commonly used counseling model that has proved effective in enhancing patient-doctor communication, doctors' confidence in counseling people, and motivating people to accept and implement change. The critical points of the 5 A's model for obesity include:
Ask: This means asking for permission to discuss one's weight and being nonjudgmental. It emphasizes exploring the person's readiness for change. 
Assess: It means assessing the patient's BMI, body mass index, waist circumference, and obesity stage. It focuses on exploring the drivers and complications of excess weight. 
Advise: It means advising the patient about the health-related risks of obesity, the benefits of modest and healthy weight loss, the need for adapting long-term strategies, and treatment options. 
Agree: It means agreeing on the patient's realistic weight-loss expectations, behavioral changes, targets, and specific details of the treatment plan. 
Assist: This means assisting the patient in identifying and addressing barriers to weight loss, providing them with resources, helping them find and consult with appropriate providers, and arranging regular follow-ups.
This model is an evidence-based behavioral intervention strategy that can help improve weight management outcomes in primary care. The 5 A's model also establishes a framework for doctors or physicians to counsel patients with obesity effectively. 
3. Motivational Interviewing (MI): This model is a patient-centered weight-loss counseling technique. MI helps the healthcare provider explore and resolve mixed feelings, ambivalence, or contradictions, thus increasing the likelihood of behavioral change. Motivational interviewing is mainly non-confrontational and collaborative, addressing doctors' or physicians' concerns about lecturing such ambivalent cases. This model can be helpful in weight management (weight loss and maintenance).
Four Principles of Motivational Interviewing:
Engaging: It emphasizes establishing a supportive and collaborative relationship with the patient; thus, it involves active listening, building trust, and empathy.
Focusing: Refers to developing a unique direction for the conversation, which involves identifying the individual's goals, priorities, and scope and areas for change related to weight loss.
Evoking: This means allowing individuals to consider what and how to change without coercion (unethical or situationally justifiable) or persuasion (being morally justifiable). It involves evoking the patient's values, motivations, and reasons for wanting to lose weight.
Planning: This involves discussing how the change will occur, thus collaboratively developing a concrete plan with the individual. The plan includes setting realistic weight loss goals, identifying potential barriers, and looking for strategies to overcome them.
These principles help healthcare providers establish behavioral change by increasing intrinsic motivation, exploring and resolving ambivalence, and promoting self-efficacy in weight loss counseling.

Effective Behavioral Strategies and Counseling for Obesity Management
Types of Motivational Interviewing Skills:
1. FRAMES: This skill is mainly used at the beginning of the conversation during the interview process and is designed to be used on individuals who are responsive to counseling about health risks and associated behavioral modifications. FRAMES stands for:
Feedback: This means providing feedback to the patient about their current behavior and the associated consequences. The feedback should be non-judgemental, specific, and based on objective information.
Responsibility: It mainly emphasizes that the patient has the power and responsibility to make choices for themselves and change their behavior. Therefore, they should be encouraged to own their actions and decisions.
Advice: It means offering advice and information about the benefits of change to the individuals and providing options and suggestions for alternative behaviors that can lead to positive outcomes.
Menu Options: This means presenting a range of options to individuals for behavior change and allowing them to explore different strategies and choose the ones that resonate with them.
Empathy: It means showing compassion and understanding towards the person's feelings, ambivalence, and struggles, and also validating their emotions and experiences, thus, creating a safe and non-judgmental space for exploration.
Self-efficacy: This focuses on fostering the person's belief in their ability to change and highlighting their strengths, potential for growth, and past successes. Thus, it encourages them to set realistic goals and develop confidence in their ability to achieve them.
2. OARS: It is a communication technique that facilitates change-talk in patients. OARS stands for:
Open-Ended Questions: This involves avoiding questions with yes or no answers and instead asking broad questions, such as "Tell me more about how you have been feeling lately." It allows individuals to express their concerns and thoughts openly. 
Affirmations: This focuses on expressing empathy towards individuals and celebrating their accomplishments, especially when they achieve a goal; the counselor or physician must rejoice in their success with them
Reflections: This means guiding individuals to express their feelings and thoughts without advising them on the next steps, reflecting on their thoughts, and showing understanding.
Summaries: This focuses on recapitulating the conversation with the individuals, thus focusing on change talk. It allows people to clear any misunderstandings. Also, the physician must end the discussion with an open-ended statement, such as "I am excited to know about your next step."

Tips for Maintaining Weight Loss for Long-Term:
One of the complex tasks is losing weight. However, maintaining weight loss for the long term is even more challenging, as most people often experience relapse after a few years of losing weight. Those who plan to lose weight should remember that whatever it took them to shed weight is the same recipe to continue maintaining weight loss. One of the theories behind this regaining of weight is that most people cut off their calorie intake to lose weight, and over time, this makes their body conditioned to burn fewer calories. Therefore, they start gaining weight after a few months due to a slow calorie-burning rate when they resume their regular diet. Thus, for this reason, healthcare professionals do not recommend rapid weight loss and an extremely low-calorie diet for a weight loss program. It is usually advised to lose around half or two pounds in a week, along with changing other lifestyle habits for the success of the weight loss program and long-term maintenance of healthy weight loss. However, individual strategies for weight loss and maintenance may vary from person to person, depending on their choices, preferences, body type, health status, and what works best for them.

## Article: Weight Loss Drugs Vs Weight Loss Methods - Weighing the Pros and Cons

A few tips to maintain weight loss include:
Staying consistent with eating and exercising plans even after losing weight to prevent relapse. 
Continue setting goals.
Practice intuitive and mindful eating.
Try eating clean, natural, and whole foods.
Stay hydrated.
Have quality sleep of seven to eight hours.
Manage stress effectively.
Find support for motivation.
Pros and Cons of Weight Loss Drugs
PROS:
Few weight loss drugs can suppress appetite, making it easier for individuals to stick to a reduced-calorie diet.
Weight loss drugs can be more effective with certain lifestyle modifications.
Some of these drugs are also known to have metabolic benefits, reducing cardiovascular risks and improving the glycemic index.
These drugs can also help in managing comorbidities linked with obesity, such as impaired glucose tolerance or hypertension (high blood pressure).
CONS:
The safety and efficacy of weight loss drugs are still not understood well due to a lack of enough long-term data, and some of these drugs are also known to cause adverse effects.
Side effects can also occur with weight loss drugs, such as increased heart rate, gastrointestinal issues, and mood changes.
These drugs are only effective when used in combination with other lifestyle and behavioral modifications, such as physical activity and diet.
Few weight loss drugs are often expensive, and insurance coverage usually does not include these drugs.
Pros and Cons of Other Weight Reduction Modes:
PROS:
Other weight reduction options, such as lifestyle changes, can improve health outcomes by helping an individual reduce weight, improve heart health, and improve other comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension due to obesity.
These interventions for weight loss (exercise and diet) are often less expensive than weight loss drugs in the long-term treatment and prevention of obesity.
Weight loss reduction options, such as lifestyle changes, offer flexibility in changing diet plans, tailored and individualized food choices, and a flexible calorie intake approach, thus increasing compliance and motivation.
These methods also normalize one's body mass index (BMI) by reversing the obesity trends with suitable interventions.
CONS:
Weight loss modes have the risk of failure or relapse post-success.
These methods are slow and steady and help with modest weight loss compared to other weight loss interventions.
These methods require long-term motivation and commitment to sustain and prevent weight gain.
These options do not offer a one-size-fits-all approach; thus, the effectiveness of these weight loss reduction methods varies from person to person.
Lifestyle modifications can often be challenging for many people, as long-term behavior cannot be changed overnight.

Section 10 - Navigating Challenges and Successes 

Challenges and Successes Related to Weight Loss Drugs

Everything has its pros and cons. Likewise, weight loss drugs come with their advantages and disadvantages. In this article, we will discuss the challenges faced by the general population and some successful outcomes based on real-life incidents after the consumption of these weight-loss drugs.


The Risky Aspect of Weight Loss Drugs

Know About the Challenges Associated With Weight Loss Medications Before Starting Them

The safety and potency of weight loss drugs vary. It has been reported that some of the most popular weight loss drugs exhibit specific side effects. Various studies have been conducted to identify the risks and adverse effects associated with these popular drugs, such as Wegovy (Semaglutide) and Mounjaru (Tirzepatide).

Obesity has become a serious global epidemic. The introduction of new-generation weight loss drugs like Semaglutide and Tirzepatide has revolutionized the therapeutic management of obesity.


## Article: Potential Side Effects of Weight loss Drugs
What Are the Adverse Effects of Common Weight Loss Drugs?

1. Phentermine - It is the oldest and most popular weight loss drug. But it has its side effects. However, this medication is contraindicated in people suffering from:
Stroke.
Glaucoma.
Heart diseases.
Hyperthyroidism. 

Side Effects:
Headaches.
Inability to sleep.
Tremors. 
Hypertension.
Rapid heart rate.

2. Phentermine Combined With Topiramate -  This combination cannot be taken during pregnancy. It is preferred as it gives promising results by reducing cravings. It comes under the brand name Qsymia Capsule.

Side Effects:
Dizziness.
Insomnia.
Xerostomia (dry mouth).
Altered taste in the mouth.
Constipation.
Stomach pain.

3. Semaglutide - In a recent clinical research conducted by the National Library of Medicine in 2023, it was found that Semaglutide (Wegovy) is quite potent in reducing obesity. It was also found to minimize the incidence of cardiovascular adverse effects. However, actual patients' clinical trials had to be stopped midway as patients complained of several adverse effects after consuming Semaglutide. 

Side Effects:
Nausea.
Severe vomiting.
Mood swings.
Bloating. 
Abdominal pain.
Constipation.
Oily stools.
Diarrhea.
Mild headache.
Weakness and fatigue.
Allergic reactions in a few cases.
Heartburn and burping.
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
Risk of thyroid cancer in a few cases. 
Pulmonary hypertension.
Kidney problems.
Pancreatitis.
Hypoglycemia. 

A few patients have also reported a loss in muscle mass after taking Semaglutide for a more extended period. A case report published in the JAMA journal in 2023 found the potential side effects of GLP-1 agonists such as Semaglutide (Wegovy). We would like to quote a real-life example that happened on our icliniq.com website. 

One of the users of icliniq, a 29-year-old female, wanted to know about the side effects and safety associated with the Semaglutide drug. Our icliniq doctor discussed the harmful effects of Semaglutide, including dizziness and gastrointestinal side effects. The doctor also highlighted the importance of trying natural weight loss methods, including exercises and healthy dieting, consulting a specialized doctor without taking over-the-counter weight loss medications, and getting a full body checkup.

One of the testimonials from our icliniq user states that she was taking Ozempic (Semaglutide) for a couple of months, after which she noticed a widespread rash across her body. She also suffered from diabetes. When she stopped taking the drug, the rash disappeared. Hence, Semaglutide has been associated with various potential risks. It is therefore advised that this drug should be prescribed with utmost precautions after taking into consideration the medical history of the patient.

4. Orlistat - This medicine works by reducing the absorption of fat from the patient's diet in the body. 

Side Effects:
Reduced absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E, and K.
Sticky, oily stools.
Black or bloody stools.
Allergic reactions like skin rash and itching.
Pain during micturition (urination).
Lack of appetite.
Pain in the upper part of the belly.
Nausea and vomiting.
Uncontrolled bowel movements.
Bloating and flatulence.
Adverse drug interactions.
Back pain.
Kidney stones in a few cases.
Anal fissures.
Difficulty breathing.
Severe liver injury in rare cases (in 2009, the FDA revised the approval guidelines and label for Orlistat due to reports of liver injury in a few clinical trials).
Risk of colorectal cancer reported (no substantial evidence present).

5. Tirzepatide - This anti-obesity drug has its own side effects. Precautions are advised before taking this drug. The side effects are divided into mild and severe ones. A warning is given on the label of Tirzepatide (Mounjaro) drug as it can cause agitation, irritation, and abnormal behaviors in an individual. In a study published in the Journal of the Endocrine Society in 2023, Mounjaro (brand name) drug showed gastrointestinal issues as the most common problem.

Mild Side Effects:
Nausea and watery stools (diarrhea) are the most common side effects.
Loss of appetite.
Dizziness.
Difficulty digesting food.
Bloating.
Flatulence.
Pain in the abdomen.
Acid reflux.
Mild pain at the injection site.
Mild skin rash or hives.
Acid reflux.
Difficulty passing stools.
Gastric pain.

Adverse Side Effects:
Kidney injury in acute cases.
Gallbladder issues.
Pancreatitis.
Risk of thyroid cancer.
Serious allergic reactions.

The side effects may last for a few days to a few weeks. People need to continue the drug for a longer period of time because if stopped, the weight loss results will be reversed.

Another important drawback of weight loss drugs is their pricing. They are quite expensive and difficult to afford. The insurance companies also do not cover these drugs. The results obtained by these weight loss drugs are temporary. Once the medication is stopped, people tend to gain the lost weight easily.

Navigating the Barriers and Limits of Weight Loss Drugs

Safety Issues and Harmful Drug Interactions- Certain weight loss drugs have serious health hazards. For instance, some weight loss drugs can show immediate unexpected drug reactions when consumed. They may show harmful interactions with other drugs or food. Certain people may also be allergic to these weight loss drugs. 

For instance, a clinical trial study published in the National Library of Medicine in the year 2008 reported the harmful effects of Orlistat (anti-obesity drug) on other drugs such as Warfarin (oral anticoagulant), Cyclosporine (immunosuppressive agent), Thyroxine (hormone), and Amiodarone (antiarrhythmic). It has been reportedly found to impact these drugs' bioavailability and effectiveness (potency). Subjects have often reported getting a red and pink rash on their hands after taking Orlistat weight loss pills. The rash waxes and wanes on its own. 

Wegovy pills can also cause skin rashes, flushing, itching, and swelling under the eyelids, lips, and upper or lower extremities in some individuals allergic to its ingredients. 

Efficiency and Potency Concerns -  Weight loss drugs may demonstrate varying results among individuals. Not everyone may achieve desirable results. The effectiveness of these medications will depend on many factors. As a result, not every individual will achieve significant weight loss.
In a clinical study published in the National Library of Medicine in 2021, it was reported that the weight loss efficacy of anti-obesity drugs ranged from 2.9 to 6.8 percent. The statistical analysis was based on a 12-month-long study. Topiramate showed 6.8 percent weight loss efficacy. Liraglutide showed 5.4 percent success results. Naltrexone showed 4 percent efficacy results, and Orlistat showed a 2.9 percent success rate. Lorcaserin showed 3.1 percent efficacy results. However, this drug has been withdrawn from the market.

Regulatory Approvals from the US FDA - Due to strict regulations imposed by the United States Food and Drug Administration, certain weight loss drugs have been withdrawn from the market even after showing effective results. 

A recent example is the anti-obesity drug Lorcaserin, which is no longer available on the market. On 13th February 2020, the FDA declared the withdrawal of this drug due to its possible role in an increased risk of cancer. 
Currently, the approved weight loss drugs available in the market include:
Orlistat.
Topiramate.
Naltrexone.
Liraglutide.
Tirzepatide.

Expensive - Weight loss drugs are very costly. They are not covered by insurance. Hence, the cost is high for many people. People are asked to pay $900 to $1000 every month. Wegovy costs approximately $1300, which is quite high in the pocket.

Holistic Lifestyle Changes - Most weight loss drugs show significant results when combined with a healthy diet, holistic lifestyle, and regular exercise. Exercise is a limitation for certain people who are reluctant to change their lifestyle.

Social Stigma - There is a certain degree of stigma associated with anti-obesity drugs. Therefore, people are sometimes hesitant to take these drugs due to the stigmatization of obesity.

Long-term Use - These drugs are found to show profound effects only when used for an extended period. And can rebound if these drugs are discontinued. This is another limitation that makes people lose their interest. Hence, these drugs show short-term success and long-term limitations.

A new poll conducted among the United States population in the year 2023 found that approximately 61 percent of people are keen on taking anti-obesity drugs. Still, their fear of the safety and effectiveness of the anti-obesity drugs restricts them from their usage. Moreover, certain factors such as injections, lack of insurance coverage, strict FDA guidelines and approvals, and continued use are some of the limitations discouraging people from using these drugs.

How Can One Stay Motivated and Overcome Setbacks During Weight Loss Journey?
There are certain tips that, if incorporated into the weight loss journey, can help overcome challenges and setbacks. We have tried to compile only those tips that have been tried and tested in the real world and have been effective in maintaining the weight loss journey. Before diving deep into the world of comprehensive weight loss, let us first understand the various factors that may negatively impact the weight loss journey.


## Article: Overcoming Weight Loss Plateaus: Staying Motivated Through the Challenges

Weight Loss Plateaus - There are a few periods in the weight loss journey when the journey towards weight loss slows down remarkably or becomes static temporarily. This becomes a disappointing experience. 

## Article: Overcoming Weight Loss Plateaus: Staying Motivated Through the Challenges

Factors that May Contribute to Weight Loss Plateaus - 

Adaptability to Metabolism - As the calorie intake is reduced, the metabolism is also slowed to conserve energy.
Hormonal Imbalances - Metabolism and fat absorption and storage in the body are largely influenced by hormonal fluctuations. 
Exercise Adaptations - The body adapts to the exercises that have been incorporated during the weight loss journey. This, in turn, impacts the effectiveness of these exercises, thereby reducing the calorie burn during workouts.
Dietary Adaptations - The body can even adapt to the calorie-deficit diet. This further creates a hurdle for the ongoing weight loss journey. 
Psychological Issues - The weight loss journey is emotionally, mentally, and physically draining. Mental stress, societal pressure, lack of sleep, and emotional eating can also negatively influence the weight loss journey.

## Article: Overcoming Weight Loss Plateaus: Staying Motivated Through the Challenges


Here are some tips to keep oneself motivated during the weight loss plateaus.

Do Not Set Unrealistic Goals - It is crucial to set achievable goals. The journey is not linear, and plateaus affect overall progress. Smaller milestones should be set instead of larger goals. Smaller steps can be managed more effectively. Instead of focusing on the scales in the weighing machine, improvement in sleep quality, inches loss, increased agility, elevated energy levels, and increased fitness should be taken into consideration for motivation.
Celebrate Small Weight Loss Victories - Reward oneself for the honest and diligent efforts. Positive reinforcement helps to reinstate confidence and motivation to continue the journey with more enthusiasm. One can celebrate nonscale victories such as fitting into a smaller old dress, improved stamina, and increased endurance. This positive behavior helps to reinforce self-confidence.
Identify the Motivation - It is a very realistic and important point. Discovering the motivation that leads one through this weight loss journey is the main driving force. Those personal reasons may include overall health goals, desire for a slim body and better appearance, or to boost self-confidence. Identifying these goals motivates one to keep going during the setbacks in the weight loss journey.
Reassess the Weight Loss Approach - If one hits a plateau, it is important to reassess the weight loss strategy, including diet, exercise regime, and lifestyle choices. One question that can pop into the  mind is whether there is any scope for improvement in certain areas or any changes required.
Increase Body Metabolism - Incorporate ways to increase the body metabolism so that the weight loss journey remains effective and stays motivated.
Keep a Healthy Track of the Weight and Measurements - It is important to monitor one's weight and inches loss on a regular basis to keep track of the progress. This step will motivate to get going and stay committed to one's desirable goals.
Stay Consistent - Consistency is key to achieving one's desired weight loss goals. No matter the setbacks, it is important to stay consistent. Even while hitting the plateaus, it is crucial to follow a healthy lifestyle. Continue the exercises, adhere to healthy diets, and stay true to the goal. Stay positive and bounce back.
Seek Professional Help - Consider seeking professional guidance from a registered dietitian, an experienced physical trainer, or a healthcare clinician who can tailor one's personalized exercise regime and customize meals according to the body's requirements. 
Prioritize Self-Care Activities - Practice good habits that help reduce stress, improve sleep, and promote positivity. Meditation and yoga are great practices that can help improve the overall mindset and promote relaxation of the body and mind.
Explore New Physical Activities -  Introduce a variety of physical activities to break the monotony. This will prevent boredom and keep one motivated throughout. Try new exercises, explore different workouts, and set new fitness goals to challenge oneself. 
Install Fitness Apps - Consider downloading some fitness apps to track the record and introduce new forms of fitness in the regime. These apps will help one stay focused and motivated. 
Maintain a Food Diary - Consider maintaining a food diary to track one's cravings and progress. Identifying the cravings will help work on them.
Find One's Favorite Physical Activity - Identifying the go-to physical activity that one enjoys and can practice regularly helps one stay motivated and burn calories.
Set Long-term Health Goals - Shift the focus from short-term success to long-term well-being. Prioritize health to stay motivated for life.
Be Patient and Believe in Oneself - The weight loss journey can be overwhelming at times, but it is important to be patient and stay positive. Believe in the efforts and trust the process because that will make a difference in the long run.
Therefore, following these simple tips and tricks with a determined mindset will help one overcome setbacks and achieve the desired weight loss goals.

## Article: The Future of Weight Loss Drugs


Section 11 - The Future of Weight Loss Drugs 

A chronic condition, obesity, is a major public concern linked to many health concerns like hypertension, hyperlipidemia (increased presence of fat in the blood), type 2 diabetes mellitus (a chronic condition where the regulation of blood sugar is impaired), stroke, metabolic syndrome (a group of conditions that increase the risk of heart conditions, diabetes, stroke, etc.), asthma, and cancer. Research is ongoing on finding medications that may help to reverse the ill effects of obesity or reduce obesity itself. Studies have been able to discover pharmacological agents that reduce the absorption of fats in food or stimulate the satiety hormones to create a feeling of fullness. Treating medical conditions that cause obesity also can be helpful in managing it. 

## Article: The Future of Weight Loss Drugs

Why Drugs Than Diet?
Medications for weight loss might be suggested in some cases where the ill effects of obesity outweigh the risks associated with treating it using some medicines. Medicines work by any one of these mechanisms:
Reducing appetite by stimulating the satiety center and creating a feeling of fullness.
Reducing absorption of nutrients.
Increasing the metabolism, thereby burning more energy.

## Article: The Future of Weight Loss Drugs

When these medications are coupled with lifestyle and diet modifications under the able guidance of a healthcare professional, weight loss can be a cakewalk. Long-term prescription drugs for weight loss are drugs that one can use for more than 12 weeks and can cause major weight loss when compared to without any medicines. Studies show that these medicines help to lose weight three to twelve percent times faster than lifestyle modifications alone can do. It also helps to manage the comorbidities better.

## Article: The Future of Weight Loss Drugs

What Research Is Being Done on This?
Initial Attempts: Early attempts to manage obesity include non-pharmacological approaches like behavioral therapy, like consuming a balanced calorie deficit diet in addition to thirty to fifty minutes of physical activity daily. Cognitive behavioral therapy is yet another strategy employed to reduce weight in obese. It includes overcoming emotional and psychological barriers in managing weight. Alternative approaches like acupuncture, vitamin D supplementation, and N-3 fatty acids supplementation have also been used in weight management. The pharmacological approach includes targeting the enzymes and hormones linked to the pathophysiology of obesity. Some of these targets include lipase (an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fats), glucagon-like peptide 1 (a hormone released in response to food in the gut), leptin (a hormone that regulates average weight in the body), and  MC4R (a gene that codes for the enzyme leptin). 
Later Advancements: The latest advancements include a study by a University of Florida professor of pharmacy and his colleagues. They discovered a new drug that caused weight loss in mice by mimicking exercise. The new compound convinces the body muscles in the mice that they are exercising more than they do, causing them to lose weight. The increased metabolism in the rats causes weight loss. In addition, it also helps to boost the mice's endurance and helps them to run twice as fast as before. This is called exercise mimetics. These drugs provide a part of the benefits of exercise without actually doing them! Though in its early stages, the drug can be used in managing obesity, diabetes, and age-related muscle loss in the later stages. 

Another drug named  SLU-PP-332 is under development, which helps boost metabolism.  It does not alter food intake, mimic exercise, or appetite. Instead, it boosts the body's natural metabolism. The metabolism is boosted in a similar way to when a person is exercising. It makes the body expend energy as if it is running for a marathon. The increased energy expenditure causes faster fat metabolism in the body. Studies in mice show that fat metabolism after using this drug is similar to when a person is fasting or while exercising. This results in weight loss. 

According to research done by Washington University in St. Louis and St. Louis University, a drug is under research that helps in the activation of some pathways that help in energy expenditure. A group of proteins called ERRs (Estrogen-related receptors) are targeted in this. Energy-using tissues like muscles, the heart, and the brain were included in this study. ERRs are activated more while exercising. However, activation using drugs still remains challenging.
In another research by the same team at St.Louis University, SLU-PP-332 was designed to activate ERRs. The research in mice also showed that it helped the mice with normal weight to run 70 percent longer than the mice that were not given the drug. The team later tested the drug on obese mice. They were given the drug twice a day and found that the weight gain was ten percent less, and weight loss was twelve percent faster than the mice that were not given the drug. The mice were given the same amount of food and did not do any exercise. The drug caused them to spend more energy just by living normally! In another research by the same team, the drug was found to strengthen the heart muscles in mice that had a weak heart. However, this aspect requires more research.
The drug has, so far, shown no adverse effects. The next phase of the study is to use it on human beings with the set criteria. Before that, it has to be modified into an edible tablet instead of an injection. The oral product will be tested on animals for any adverse effects before starting its use for human trials.

What Are the Potential Barriers to Developing Weight-Loss Drugs?
Other drugs were being studied, but none were able to reach the market. One of the main reasons behind it was the long duration it took to develop a drug that had no or minimal adverse effects. 
The Complexity of the Condition:Drugs specifically for obesity make the task even more difficult due to the complexity of the condition. Maintaining muscle mass during weight loss is another challenge. More research is needed to modify the drug to prevent these adverse effects. 
How To Address: Studying the individuals properly and classifying them accordingly can help (to an extent, of course!) to minimize the ill effects due to the complexity. This can be time-consuming, but it yields better and more accurate results.

Type of Individuals Using: Another challenge is the body type of the individual using the drug for weight loss. The results were visible in obese mice in studies. However, its effects (or rather adverse effects) when used in people with normal weight are still debatable. It is still unclear if there will be any weight loss; more research is required.
How To Address: Proper analysis of the candidates before starting the trial or studying the various body features before prescribing a medicine for the individual can help to prevent errors or shortcomings due to this.

Return of the Lost Weight: Studies that were done on people who used weight loss drugs showed that they regained two-thirds of the lost weight a year after the treatment was stopped.  Developing something that can give a permanent cure for obesity is still challenging and might need more research.
How To Address: More research can be done on developing drugs that can give long-term or permanent results with minimal side effects.

Cost: Weight loss drugs are still expensive, as a lot of research has been put behind them. The cost of these drugs can be a factor that can prevent people from using them in the long run. In addition, the cost of clinical trials can prevent further research.
How To Address: Including more sponsorships can help to reduce the burden due to the expenses of clinical trials. Companies that focus on wellness, physical health, and the same can be encouraged to be partners in the trials. Encouraging pharmacological companies to reduce overpricing can help to make the common man buy the drug and use it consistently or as advised by the healthcare professional.

Heterogeneity of Patient Cohorts: Obesity is a complex condition with heterogeneous factors. Hence, the cohorts in the trials may have various causes and co-existing conditions. 
How To Address: Grouping the participants based on similar causes and conditions helps to provide more accurate results. Proper analysis of the candidates before grouping them is essential to avoid confusion and discrepancies.

Neuroendocrine Factors: Many endocrine factors, along with the hypothalamus and the other parts of the brain, play an important role in food intake and metabolism. It can negatively impact a study on weight-loss drugs, as different people's bodies react in different ways to give results. The results, in addition, may vary from person to person. Peripheral adiposity signals, mainly from hormones like leptin and insulin, after weight loss and prolonged fasting can cause an increase in sensitivity to certain factors in the hypothalamus and hindbrain. Alternatively, a decrease in the expression of these signals can cause a double-barrelled defense of body weight. A fluctuation in these signals due to persistent elevation can result in desensitization. This can lead to impaired response to the homeostatic system. 
How To Address: Managing this can be time-consuming and tricky. Grouping the participants as they show signs like delayed weight loss, increased hunger, increased fatigue, etc., can help to an extent. 

Changes in Pharmacology in Animals to Humans: There can be differences in the way a drug can react to the body in humans and animals. It could be due to the difference in their body weights, differences in the metabolism of glucose and lipids, and many other factors. 
How To Address: This challenge is inevitable, as the mechanism of action of a drug in an animal and human can differ in many ways. Trying to predict the possible outcomes and attempting to take measures to avoid them may help.

Safety Concerns: Safety is one of the major concerns while developing any medicine. The associated risk of toxicity is inevitable to an extent. Small doses might have little effect on an individual, while it can bring about a negative impact on another. Hence, safety concerns can be a challenge that can limit the scope of studies on weight loss drugs. 
How To Address: A proper understanding of how a drug can possibly work in the body can help to prevent adverse effects of the drug. However, it is inevitable to an extent. Pepper documentation on the conditions that caused the adverse effect can help to prevent them from repeating later. 

Patient Compliance: Patient compliance is essential for any drug research to be successful. Failure to adhere to the prescription may not give the proper result for the medication. In addition, it may give some additional adverse or undesirable effects.  
How To Address: This is another factor that depends on the patient alone. Educating the patient properly and giving them an idea of the possible drawbacks if they do not adhere to the prescription can help increase compliance.

What Are the Future Prospects of Weight Loss Drugs?
During the June 2023 American Diabetes Association (ADA) convention, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly presented updated information on two oral prospects, Semaglutide and Orforglipron, respectively. The efficacy readings of more than 15 percent demonstrated how rapidly the market is growing. As many trials are initiated across the globe, it not only helps to treat a wider range of people but also eliminates the lack of supply.

Route of Administration: Most of the drugs that have been developed so far are subcutaneous (injected under the skin). Hence, more trials are happening to find a better route of administration that is easy and comfortable. Research on drugs that can be administered orally is in its final stage. The majority of the drugs that are currently being used in weight loss were initially used in the management of type 2 diabetes. Hence, it is appreciated that the development of these weight-loss drugs can have dual or triple agonists. 
Site of Action: Multiple pharma companies are working on developing drugs that can influence more than one hormone that can act on the brain at a time to cause weight loss. The ongoing research on animal studies gives promising prospects in this field. A recent study showed a drug called Tirzepatide, which combines the action of two hormones, hormones GLP-1 and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), to cause weight loss faster. GIP stimulates insulin secretion (similar to GLP-1) around mealtime and makes it possible for weight management. 
Muscle Mass: A study showed that another drug named Bimagrumab (which is an antibody that blocks activin type II receptors and activates the growth of skeletal) is effective in weight loss by losing adipose tissue and producing more lean mass in obese people with type 2 diabetes. Further research can enable the development of a novel drug that can be used in weight loss without losing lean muscle mass.
